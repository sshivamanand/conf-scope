    "abstractText" : "We propose a directed graphical representation of util­ ity functions, called UCP-networks, that combines as­ pects of two existing preference models: generalized additive models and CP-networks. The network de­ composes a utility function into a number of additive factors, with the directionality of the arcs reflecting conditional dependence in the underlying (qualitative) preference ordering under a ceteris paribus interpreta­ tion. The CP-semantics ensures that computing opti­ mization and dominance queries is very efficient. We also demonstrate the value of this representation in de­ cision making. Finally, we describe an interactive elic­ itation procedure that takes advantage of the linear na­ ture of the constraints on \"tradeoff weights\" imposed by a UCP-network.",
