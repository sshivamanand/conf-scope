      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Kernel methods are widely used in statistical learning [17, 18]. Positive definite symmetric (PDS) kernels specify an inner product in an implicit Hilbert space where large-margin methods are used for learning and estimation. They can be combined with algorithms such as support vector machines (SVMs) [5, 10, 20] or other kernel-based algorithms to form powerful learning techniques.\nBut, the choice of the kernel, which is critical to the success of the algorithm, is typically left to the user. Rather than requesting the user to commit to a specific kernel, which may not be optimal for the task, especially if the user’s prior knowledge about the task is poor, learning kernel methods require him only to specify a family of kernels. The learning algorithm then selects both the specific kernel out of that family, and the hypothesis defined with respect to that kernel.\nThere is a large body of literature dealing with various aspects of the problem of learning kernels, including theoretical questions, optimization problems related to this problem, and experimental results [13, 15, 2, 1, 19, 16, 14, 23, 11, 3, 8, 22, 9]. Some of this previous work considers families of Gaussian kernels [15] or hyperkernels [16]. Non-linear combinations of kernels have been recently considered by [21, 3, 9]. But, the most common family of kernels examined is that of non-negative combinations of some fixed kernels constrained by a trace condition, which can be viewed as an L1 regularization [13], or by an L2 regularization [8].\nThis paper presents several novel generalization bounds for the problem of learning kernels for the family of convex combinations of base kernels or linear combinations with an L2 constraint. One of the first learning bounds given by Lanckriet et al. [13] for the family of convex combinations of p base kernels is similar to that of Bousquet and Herrmann [6] and has the following form: R(h) ≤ R̂ρ(h) + O (\n1√ m √ maxpk=1 Tr(Kk)max p i=1(‖Kk‖/Tr(Kk))/ρ2 ) where R(h) is the generalization error of a hypothesis h, Rρ(h) is the fraction of training points with margin less than or equal to ρ and Kk is the kernel matrix associated to the kth base kernel. This bound was later shown by Srebro and Ben-David [19] to be always larger than one. Another bound by Lanckriet et al. [13] for the family of linear combinations of base kernels was also shown by the same authors to be always larger than one.\nBut Lanckriet et al. [13] also presented a multiplicative bound for convex combinations of base kernels\nthat is of the form R(h) ≤ R̂ρ(h) + O (√ p/ρ2\nm\n) . This bound converges and can perhaps be viewed as\nthe first informative generalization bound for this family of kernels. However, the dependence of the bound on the number of kernels p is multiplicative which therefore does not encourage the use of too many base kernels. Srebro and Ben-David [19] presented a generalization bound based on the pseudo-dimension of the family of kernels that significantly improved on this bound. Their bound has the form R(h) ≤ R̂ρ(h) + Õ (√ p+R2/ρ2\nm\n) , where the notation Õ(·) hides logarithmic terms and whereR is an upper bound onKk(x, x)\nfor all points x and base kernels kk , k ∈ [1, p]. Thus, disregarding logarithmic terms, their bound is only additive in p. Their analysis also applies to other families of kernels. Ying and Campbell [22] also give generalization bounds for learning kernels based on the notion of Rademacher chaos complexity and the pseudo-dimension of the family of kernels used. It is not clear however how their bound compares to that of Srebro and Ben-David. We present new generalization bounds for the family of convex combinations of base kernels that have only a logarithmic dependency on p. Our learning bound is based on a careful analysis of the Rademacher complexity of the hypothesis set considered and has the form: R(h) ≤ R̂ρ(h) + O (√ (log p)R2/ρ2\nm\n) . Our bound is simpler and contains no other extra logarithmic term. Thus, this represents\na substantial improvement over the previous best bounds for this problem. Our bound is also valid for a very large number of kernels, in particular for p ≫ m, while the previous bounds were not informative in that case.\nWe also present new generalization bounds for the family of linear combinations of base kernels with an L2 regularization. We had previously given a stability bound for an algorithm extending kernel ridge regression to learning kernels that had an additive dependency with respect to p [8] assuming a technical condition of orthogonality on the base kernels. The complexity term of our bound was of the formO(1/\n√ m+√\np/m). Our new learning bound admits only a mild dependency of p1/4 on the number of base kernels. The next section (Section 2) defines the family of kernels and hypothesis sets we examine. Section 3 presents a bound on the Rademacher complexity of the class of convex combinations of base kernels with an L1 constraint and a generalization bond for binary classification directly derived from that result. Similarly, Section 4 presents first a bound on the Rademacher complexity, then a generalization bound for the case of an of L2 regularization."

Then, we can bound the expectation as follows:\nE σ\n[∥∥ m∑\ni=1\nσiΦk(xi) ∥∥r ] = E\nσ\n[( m∑\ni,j=1\nσiσjKk(xi, xj) )r′]\n≤ ∑\n1≤i1,...,ir′≤m 1≤j1,...,jr′≤m\n∣∣∣E σ [ σi1σj1 · · ·σir′σjr′ ]∣∣∣ ∣∣∣Kk(xi1 , xj1 ) · · ·Kk(xir′ , xjr′ ) ∣∣∣\n≤ ∑\n1≤i1,...,ir′≤m 1≤j1,...,jr′≤m\n∣∣∣E σ [ σi1σj1 · · ·σir′σjr′ ]∣∣∣(Kk(xi1 , xi1) · · ·Kk(xir′ , xir′ ))1/2\n(Kk(xj1 , xj1) · · ·Kk(xjr′ , xjr′ ))1/2 (Cauchy-Schwarz)\n= ∑\ns1+...+sm=2r′\n( 2r′\ns1,...,sm )∣∣∣E σ [ σs11 · · ·σsmm ]∣∣∣Kk(x1, x1)s1/2 · · ·Kk(xm, xm)sm/2.\nSince E[σi] = 0 for all i and since the Rademacher variables are independent, we can write E[σi1 . . . σil ] =\nE[σi1 ] · · ·E[σil ] = 0 for any l distinct variables σi1 , . . . , σil . Thus, Eσ [ σs11 · · ·σsm1 ] = 0 unless all sis are even, in which case Eσ [ σs11 · · ·σsmm ] = 1.

Assume that Kk(x, x) ≤ R2 for all x ∈ X and k ∈ [1, p]. Then, Tr[Kk] ≤ mR2 for any k ∈ [1, p], thus the Rademacher complexity can be bounded as follows\nR̂S(Hp) ≤ 1\nmρ (p(\n√ rmR2)r)1/r = p1/rr1/2\n√ R2/ρ2\nm .\nFor p > 1, the function r 7→ p1/rr1/2 reaches its minimum at r0 = 2 log p. This gives\nR̂S(Hp) ≤ √\n2e⌈log p⌉R2/ρ2 m .\nIt is likely that the constants in the bound of theorem can be further improved. We used a very rough upper bound for the multinomial coefficients. A finer bound using Sterling’s approximation should provide a better result. Remarkably, the bound of the theorem has a very mild dependency with respect to p.\nThe theorem can be used to derive generalization bounds for learning kernels in classification, regression, and other tasks. We briefly illustrate its application to binary classification where the labels y are in {−1,+1}. Let R(h) denote the generalization error of h ∈ Hp, that is R(h) = Pr[yh(x) < 0]. For a training sample S = ((x1, y1), . . . , (xm, ym)) and any ρ > 0, let R̂ρ(h) denote the fraction of the training points with margin less than or equal to ρ, that is R̂ρ(h) = 1m ∑m i=1 1yih(xi)≤ρ. Then, the following result holds.\nCorollary 2 For any δ > 0, with probability at least 1− δ, the following bound holds for any h ∈ Hp:\nR(h) ≤ R̂ρ(h) + 2‖τ‖r mρ + 2 √ log 2δ 2m . (7)\nwith τ = ( √ rTr[K1], . . . , √ rTr[Kp])\n⊤, for any even integer r > 0. If additionally, Kk(x, x) ≤ R2 for all x ∈ X and k ∈ [1, p], then, for p > 1,\nR(h) ≤ R̂ρ(h) + 2 √\n2e⌈log p⌉R2/ρ2 m + 2 √ log 2δ 2m .\nProof: With our definition of the Rademacher complexity, for any δ > 0, with probability at least 1 − δ, the following bound holds for any h ∈ Hp [12, 4]:\nR(h) ≤ R̂ρ(h) + 2R̂S(Hp) + 2 √ log 2δ 2m . (8)\n1We use the following rather rough inequality:\n` 2r ′\n2t1,...,2tm\n´ = (2r′)!\n(2t1)! · · · (2tm)! ≤\n(2r′)!\n(t1)! · · · (tm)! ≤\n(2r′) · · · (r′ + 1) · r′!\n(t1)! · · · (tm)! ≤\n(2r′)r ′ · r ′!\n(t1)! · · · (tm)! = (2r′)r\n′` r ′\nt1,...,tm\n´\n.\nPlugging in the bound on the empirical Rademacher complexity given by Theorem 1 yields the statement of the corollary.\nThe corollary gives a generalization bound for learning kernels with Hp that is in\nO\n(√ (log p) R2/ρ2\nm\n) . (9)\nIn comparison, the bound for this problem given by Srebro and Ben-David [19] using the pseudo-dimension has a stronger dependency with respect to p and is more complex:\nO\n(√\n8 2 + p log 128em\n3R2 ρ2p + 256 R2 ρ2 log ρem 8R log 128mR2 ρ2\nm\n) . (10)\nThis bound is also not informative for p > m.\n4 Rademacher complexity bound for H ′ p\nTheorem 3 For any sample S of size m, the Rademacher complexity of the hypothesis set H ′p can be bounded as follows:\nR̂S(H ′ p) ≤ ‖τ‖r mρ with τ = ( √ rTr[K1], . . . , √ rTr[Kp]) ⊤, (11)\nfor any even integer 0 < r ≤ 4. If additionally, Kk(x, x) ≤ R2 for all x ∈ X and k ∈ [1, p], then, for any p ≥ 1,\nR̂S(H ′ p) ≤ 2p1/4\n√ R2/ρ2\nm .\nThis bound also hold without the condition µk ≥ 0, k ∈ [1, p], on the hypothesis set H ′p. Proof: We can proceed as in the proof for bounding the Rademacher complexity of Hp, except for bounding the following term:\n( p∑\nk=1\n‖wk‖q )1/q = [ p∑\nk=1\nµqk(α ⊤ Kkα)\nq/2 ]1/q\n= [ p∑\nk=1\nµ2k(µ 2(q−2) q k α ⊤ Kkα)\nq/2 ]1/q\n≤ [ ( p∑\nk=1\nµ2k µ 2(q−2) q k α ⊤ Kkα)\nq/2 ]1/q\n(convexity)\n=\n√√√√ p∑\nk=1\nµ 4(q−1) q\nk α ⊤Kkα.\nAssume now that q > 4/3, which implies 4(q−1)q < 1. Then, since µk ∈ [0, 1], this implies µ 4(q−1) q\nk ≤ µk. Thus, for any q > 4/3, we can write:\n( p∑\nk=1\n‖wk‖q )1/q ≤\n√√√√ p∑\nk=1\nµkα⊤Kkα = √ α⊤Kα ≤ 1/ρ2.\nTaking the limit q → 4/3 shows that the inequality is also verified for q = 4/3. Thus, as in the proof for Hp, the Rademacher complexity can be bounded as follows\nR̂S(H ′ p) ≤ ‖τ‖r mρ with τ = ( √ rTr[K1], . . . , √ rTr[Kp]) ⊤, (12)\nbut here r is an even integer such that 1/r = 1 − 1/q ≥ 1 − 3/4 = 1/4, that is r ≤ 4. Assume that Kk(x, x) ≤ R2 for all x ∈ X and k ∈ [1, p]. Then, Tr[Kk] ≤ mR2 for any k ∈ [1, p], thus, for r = 4, the Rademacher complexity can be bounded as follows\nR̂S(H ′ p) ≤\n1\nmρ (p(\n√ 4mR2)4)1/4 = 2p1/4\n√ R2/ρ2\nm .\nThus, in this case, the bound has a mild dependence ( 4 √·) on the number of kernels p. Proceeding as in\nthe L1 case leads to the following margin bound in binary classification.\nCorollary 4 For any δ > 0, with probability at least 1− δ, the following bound holds for any h ∈ Hp:\nR(h) ≤ R̂ρ(h) + 2‖τ‖r mρ + 2 √ log 2δ 2m . (13)\nwith τ = ( √ rTr[K1], . . . , √ rTr[Kp])\n⊤, for any even integer r ∈ {2, 4}. If additionally, Kk(x, x) ≤ R2 for all x ∈ X and k ∈ [1, p], then, for any p ≥ 1,\nR(h) ≤ R̂ρ(h) + 4p1/4 √ R2/ρ2\nm + 2 √ log 2δ 2m ."
