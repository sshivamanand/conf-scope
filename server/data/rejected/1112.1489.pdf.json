      "text" : "The ability to conceptualize the world at different granularities and to switch among these granularities is fundamental to human intelligence and flexibility [9][19]. To simulate such an ability of human problem solving, Granular Computing (GrC) was proposed. In fact, there have existed many concrete models of granular computing, such as computing with words [17][18], rough set theory [12], formal concept analysis [8], quotient space theory [19], etc.\nGranulation [18][10], grouping some elements of the domain into granules, is a fundamental step towards granular computing. Idealized granulation should yield pairwise disjoint granules such as equivalence classes or partition blocks. However, incompleteness and impreciseness of information, as well as variant similarity of individuals, always result in overlapping among granules. Consequently, granular worlds are always formalized as a set equipped with a family of nonempty subsets whose union equals to the universe, which is precisely the covering model [10].\nFor any given covering, both union and intersection of covering blocks containing the given element can be viewed as induced granules, which form two new coverings representing granular worlds at different abstraction levels. Consequently, transformations among these three covering are important and interesting in that they simulate the process of switching among granularities, which are precisely our respect of discussion.\nPawlak’s roughs set provides a concrete framework performing granular computing based on partition or equivalence relation, however, absolute disjointness among granules restrict applications of classical rough set theory, so generalized rough set models based on covering are extensively researched, and many results such as axiomization and reduction theory are obtained (see, for example, in [20][21][22][23] for details). In these researches, union and intersection of covering blocks containing the given element were always called the friend and neighborhood, respectively, and they were exploited as basic knowledge to approximate unknown knowledge. However, transformations among induced granular worlds as well as relational interpretations of friend and neighborhood are not discussed, while the latter naturally results in axiomization of several types of covering based rough approximation operators.\nThe paper is organized as follows: Based on the definition of star and closure of an element, two granular worlds are induced in section 2, and transformations among them are also discussed. Section 3 investigates axiomization and relational interpretation of four types of covering rough approximation operators, and it is proved that these operators exploit induced granules, rather than given covering blocks, as basic knowledge to approximate unknown knowledge. Conclusions and discussions are grouped in the final section.\nThroughout this paper, we do not restrict the universe of discourse U to be finite. The class of all subsets of U will be denoted by ℘(U). For any X ⊆ U , −X will be used to denote the complement of X . For any subset system F ⊆ ℘(U), we will denote {−F | F ∈ F} as Fc. Obviously, (Fc)c = F . Moreover, I always denotes arbitrary index set."

      "text" : "A family β of nonempty subsets of U is called a covering of U if ⋃ {B|B ∈ β} = U , and any B ∈ β is called a covering block. Obviously, covering generalizes partition in that overlapping among covering blocks are permitted. For any x ∈ U , let βx denote the collection of covering blocks containing x, namely βx = {B| x ∈ B ∈ β}.\nDefinition 1 ([3][6]). For any x ∈ U , the star and point closure of x with respect to β, denoted by star(x, β) and ↓x, are defined as the union and intersection of covering blocks containing x, respectively.\nFormally, ∀x ∈ U , star(x, β) = ⋃ {B| B ∈ βx} and ↓x = ⋂ {B| B ∈ βx}. In [22][20], star(x, β) and ↓x are called friend and neighborhood of x, and denoted by Friends(x) and Neighbor(x), respectively. In the followings, the collection of stars and point closures with respect to covering β are denoted by S(β) and P(β), namely S(β) = {star(x, β)| x ∈ U} and P(β) = {↓x| x ∈ U}. Both the star system and the point closure system are coverings of U since x ∈ star(x, β) and x ∈↓x hold for any x ∈ U .\nDefinition 2 ([3]). For any coverings α and β, if for any A ∈ α there exists B ∈ β such that A ⊆ B, then α is called a refinement of β, denoted by β ⊑ α.\nProposition 1. S(β) ⊑ β ⊑ P(β).\nFor any x ∈ U , star(x, β) and ↓x are regarded as granules of different grain size, then Proposition 1 implies that the two induced coverings represent granular worlds at different abstraction levels.\nDefinition 3 ([6]). For any covering β, the specialization preordering β induced by β is defined as: ∀x, y ∈ U , y β x ⇔ (∀K ∈ β)(x ∈ K → y ∈ K).\nIn general, specialization preordering β is reflexive and transitive but not necessarily antisymmetric. Moreover, point closure ↓ x is precisely the principal down-set {y| y β x} generated by x with respect to β. The following Proposition 2 characterizes the structure of P(β).\nProposition 2. For any covering β of U , ∀x, y ∈ U , then\n1. y ∈↓x if and only if ↓y ⊆↓x. 2. ↓x = ⋃ {↓z| z ∈↓x}, ↓x = ⋂ {↓z| x ∈↓z}.\nFor further discussion, we need to recall some notations about binary relation. For any binary relation R on U and x ∈ U , R(x) = {y ∈ U | xRy} and R−1 = {〈v, u〉| uRv}. Particularly, when ≤ is a partial ordering or preordering, ≤−1 is always called the dual of ≤ and denoted by ≥. Moreover, ↑x = {y ∈ U | x ≤ y} and ↓x = {y ∈ U | y ≤ x} are called principal up-set and principal down-set generated by x, respectively [6].\nFor any covering β, the subset system βc = {−B| B ∈ β} is not necessarily a covering of U any more. In fact, βc is also a covering of U if and only if⋂ {B| B ∈ β} = ∅, or equivalently, there exist B ∈ β such that x /∈ B holds for any x ∈ U . However, the specialization preordering βc can be still defined, and we have the following proposition characterizing the relationship between β and βc .\nProposition 3 ([6]). For any covering β of U , the specialization preordering βc is precisely the dual of β, namely βc= β.\nDefinition 4 ([6]). For any covering β of U , x ∈ U , the point closure of x with respect to the subset system βc is called the core of x, denoted by ↑x.\nFor any x ∈ U , ↑x = ⋂ {D| x ∈ D ∈ βc} and P(βc) = {↑x| x ∈ U}. It is easy to verify that ↑x is precisely the principal up-set {y ∈ U | x β y} generated by x with respect to β. Note that P(βc) is also a covering of U since x ∈↑x holds for any x ∈ U .\nAny covering β can also induces a binary relation Tβ determined by ⋃ {B × B| B ∈ β}. Moreover, ∀x ∈ U , Tβ(x) = star(x, β). Then we have the following relational characterizations of the three induced coverings.\nTheorem 1. For any covering β, point closure systems P(β) = { β(x)|x ∈ U}, P(βc) = { β(x)| x ∈ U}, and star system S(β) = {Tβ(x)| x ∈ U}."

      "heading" : "2.2 Transformations among Induced Granular Worlds",
      "text" : "Note that, according to Proposition 1, P transforms a coarser granular world into finer one, while S transforms a finer granular world into coarser one, so they can be understood as unary operations on covering simulating the process of switching among different granular worlds. Proposition 2 only tells us that P(P(β)) = P(β), namely P is an idempotent operation. To completely understand these transformations, we need to study P and S further.\nFor any covering β, Tβ is a tolerance, a binary relation satisfying reflexivity and symmetry [1]. Theorem 1 implies that tolerance relation will be an useful tool to investigate properties of S, so we will firstly recall some basic definitions and facts about tolerance relation.\nLet T be any tolerance relation on U , x ∈ U , the T -relative set T (x) is always called T -class, and we will denote the family of all T -classes as C(T ), namely C(T ) = {T (x)|x ∈ U}. Obviously, C(T ) is an covering induced by T , and for any covering β, S(β) = C(Tβ).\nA T -preblock is any subset B ⊆ U such that xTy holds for any x, y ∈ B. Any subset B ⊆ U is called a T -block if and only if it is a T -preblock such that for any x /∈ B, there exists b ∈ B satisfying ¬(bTx). In the current paper, the family of all T -blocks will be denoted as B(T ), which is also an induced covering by T . It is well known that there exists one-to-one correspondence between the collection of all tolerance relations and the collection of all T -blocks on U . Moreover, we have the following Proposition 4, which not only characterizes the relationship between T -classes and T -blocks, but also implies that C(T ) = S(B(T )).\nProposition 4 ([1]). Let (U, T ) be any tolerance space, x ∈ U , B ∈ B(T ), then T (x) = ⋃ {B| x ∈ B}, B = ⋂ {T (x)| x ∈ B}.\nFor any tolerance space (U, T ) and x ∈ U , the intersection of T -classes containing x was called compatibility kernel 〈x〉T in [5], namely 〈x〉T = ⋂ {T (y)|x ∈ T (y)}, and the family of all compatibility kernels was denoted by 〈U〉T . Obviously, 〈x〉T =↓x, in which ↓x is the point closure of x with respect to covering C(T ). Furthermore, we have 〈U〉T = P(C(T )). It was also proved in [5] that 〈x〉T = ⋂ {B| x ∈ B ∈ B(T )}, or equivalently, P(B(T )) = P(C(T )). So in the following, the point closure system P(T ) of a tolerance relation T is always referred to P(B(T )) or P(C(T )).\nProposition 5. Let (U, T ) be any tolerance space, x, y ∈ U , B ∈ B(T ), then\n1. B = ⋃ {↓y| y ∈ B}, T (x) = ⋃ {↓y| y ∈ T (x)}. 2. ⋃ {↓y| x ∈↓y} ⊆ T (x).\nThe proofs of the above proposition is trivial, however, it should be pointed out that ⋃ {↓y| x ∈↓y} ⊇ T (x) does not hold in general. Now we turn to discuss the relationship between P(S(β)) and P(β).\nProposition 6. For any covering β of U , P(S(β)) = P(Tβ) ⊑ P(β). Furthermore, if β is precisely B(T ) with respect to tolerance T , then P(S(β)) = P(β).\nProof. It is sufficient to prove that ↓x ⊆ 〈x〉Tβ holds for any x ∈ U . Note that y ∈↓x ⇔ ∀B ∈ β(x ∈ B → y ∈ B), then if x ∈ Tβ(z) = ⋃ {B| z ∈ B ∈ β}, there must exists B0 ∈ β such that x ∈ B0 and z ∈ B0. So y ∈ B0 and z ∈ B0 holds, which follows that y ∈ Tβ(z). Hence, ∀z ∈ U(x ∈ Tβ(z) → y ∈ Tβ(z)), namely ↓x ⊆ 〈x〉Tβ .\nIf β is precisely B(T ) with respect to tolerance relation T , then ↓x = 〈x〉Tβ holds for any x ∈ U .\nRemark 1. The converse of proposition 6 is not true in general. Let U = {1, 2, 3} and β = {{1, 3}, {2, 3}, {3}}, then ↓x = 〈x〉 holds for any x ∈ U , however, β is not the family of tolerance blocks at all.\nFor any tolerance relation T , C(T ), B(T ) and P(T ) are all coverings of U induced by T , which represent granular worlds at different abstraction level. We also have known that P(C(T )) = P(T ) = P(B(T )) and S(B(T )) = C(T ). In general, however, TP(T )(x) ⊆ T (x) for any x ∈ U , or equivalently C(T ) ⊑ S(P(T )), in which TP(T ) denotes the tolerance relation induced by P(T ) = {〈x〉T |x ∈ U}. The following theorem characterizes sufficient and necessary condition of S(P(T )) = C(T ), or equivalently T = TP(T ).\nTheorem 2 ([5]). For any tolerance relation T , then TP(T ) = T if and only if, for any a, b ∈ U , aT b implies that there exists c ∈ U such that a ∈ 〈c〉T and b ∈ 〈c〉T .\nAn interesting conclusion of Proposition 6 and Theorem 2 is S(P(S(P(α)))) = S(P(α)) holds for any covering α, which implies that the composition of P and S is also idempotent.\nTheorem 3. For any covering α of U , we denote P(α) by β, then TP(Tβ) = Tβ.\nProof. Note that P(P(α)) = P(α) and β = P(α), then ↓αx =↓βx ,↓x, in which ↓αx and ↓βx denote the point closure of x with respect to α and β, respectively. By the proof of Proposition 6, ↓x ⊆ 〈x〉Tβ holds for any x ∈ U .\nFor any a, b ∈ U , since Tβ(x) = ⋃ {↓y|x ∈↓y}, if aTβb then there exists c ∈ U such that a ∈↓c and b ∈↓c, so a ∈ 〈c〉Tβ and b ∈ 〈c〉Tβ . According to Theorem 2, we have TP(Tβ) = Tβ."

Particularly, if R is reflexive then ClR(X) = R(X) (or equivalently, IntR(X) = R(X)). For any given covering space, different types of covering based rough approximation operators have been proposed [2][13][21][23]. In this subsection, we will mainly discuss relational interpretations and axiomatic characterizations of four types of covering based rough approximation operators.\nDefinition 7 ([22][20]). For any covering β of U , operators FH,FL : ℘(U) → ℘(U) are defined as follows: ∀X ⊆ U ,\nFH(X) = ⋃ {B ∈ β| B ⋂ X 6= ∅}\nFL(X) = {x ∈ U | ∀B ∈ β(x ∈ B → B ⊆ X)} We call FH, FL the first type of covering upper and lower operators, respectively.\nIt is obvious that FH and FL are dual. Moreover, we have following relational interpretation of FH and FL.\nProposition 9. For any covering β of U , let Tβ denote the induced tolerance relation, then ∀X ⊆ U ,\nFH(X) = {x ∈ U | Tβ(x) ⋂\nX 6= ∅} FL(X) = {x ∈ U | Tβ(x) ⊆ X}\nProof. Since FH and FL are dual operators, it is sufficient to prove only the half. ∀y ∈ ⋃ {B ∈ β| B ⋂ X 6= ∅}, there exists B0 ∈ β and y ∈ B0, which follows Tβ(y) ⋂ X 6= ∅, then y ∈ {x ∈ U | Tβ(x) ⋂ X 6= ∅}. On the other hand, ∀y ∈ {x ∈ U | Tβ(x) ⋂\nX 6= ∅}, there exists B0 ∈ β such that y ∈ B0 and B0 ⋂ X 6= ∅, then y ∈ ⋃ {B ∈ β| B ⋂ X 6= ∅}.\nProposition 10.

Furthermore, we have the following axiomatic characterization of FH .\nTheorem 5. For any mapping H : ℘(U) → ℘(U), ∀x, y ∈ U , X ⊆ U and Xi ⊆ U (∀i ∈ I), then H satisfies the following properties (1H)-(4H):\n(1H) H(∅) = ∅ (2H) X ⊆ H(X) (3H) H( ⋃ Xi) = ⋃ H(Xi)\n(4H) y ∈ H(x) ⇔ x ∈ H(y) if and only if there exists a covering β such that H = FH.\nProof. Suppose H satisfies properties (1H)-(4H). We define T ⊆ U × U : ∀x, y ∈ U , xTy ⇔ y ∈ H(x), then T is tolerance relation and T (x) = H(x) holds for any x ∈ U . Let β = B(T ), then FH = ClTβ and FH(x) = ⋃ {B ∈ β| x ∈ B} = T (x) = H(x). Furthermore, considering the quasi-discreteness of ClTβ , ∀X ⊆ U , we have FH(X) = ⋃ FH(x) = ⋃ H(x) = H(X), which follows FH = H .\nBy Proposition 10, FH(X) = Clβ(X) holds for any X ⊆ U , so the proof of the sufficiency is trivial.\nRemark 2. In the proof of sufficiency, the covering β is not unique. For example, the family of binary subsets {x, y} such that y ∈ H(x) is chosen as the covering β in [20].\nThe second type of covering rough approximation operators can be regarded as a special case of the first ones in the sense that the covering is an induced point closure system, however, their axiomatic characterization are different.\nDefinition 8 ([21][20]). For any covering β, operators SH, SL : ℘(U) → ℘(U) are defined as follows: ∀X ⊆ U ,\nSH(X) = ⋃ {↓x| ↓x ⋂ X 6= ∅}\nSL(X) = {x ∈ U | ∀y ∈ U(x ∈↓y →↓y ⊆ X)} We call SH, SL the second type of covering upper and lower operators, respectively.\nThen, in a completely similar way, we have the following Proposition 11 and Proposition 12.\nProposition 11. For any covering β of U , let TP(β) denote the induced tolerance relation, then ∀X ⊆ U ,\nSH(X) = {x ∈ U | TP(β)(x) ⋂ X 6= ∅} SL(X) = {x ∈ U | TP(β)(x) ⊆ X}\nProposition 12. For any X ⊆ U , SH(X) = ClP(β)(X) and SL(X) = IntP(β)(X), in which ClP(β) and IntP(β) are Cěch quasi-discrete closure and interior operators bijectively corresponding to TP(β), respectively.\nProposition 12 implies that SH and SL are generalized rough upper/lower approximation operators based on tolerance relation TP(β), or equivalently, granules TP(β)(x) of induced granular world S(P(β)) are basic knowledge blocks.\nTheorem 6. Let H : ℘(U) → ℘(U), ∀x, y ∈ U , X ⊆ U and Xi ⊆ U holds for any i of arbitrary index set I, then there exists a covering β such that H = SH if and only if H satisfies (1H)-(4H) and the following property (5H):\n(5H) if y ∈ H(x), there exists u ∈ U such that x, y ∈ ⋂ {H(z)| u ∈ H(z)}\nProof. Suppose H satisfies properties (1H)-(4H). We define T ⊆ U × U : ∀x, y ∈ U , xTy ⇔ y ∈ H(x), then T is tolerance relation and T (x) = H(x) holds for any x ∈ U . Note that 〈x〉T = ⋂ {H(z)| x ∈ H(z)}, so according to Theorem 2, we have T = TP(T ). Let β = B(T ), then TP(β) = TP(T ) = T , so for any x ∈ U , SH(x) = ⋃ {↓ y| x ∈↓ y} = T (x) = H(x). Considering the quasi-discreteness of ClP(β), we have SH(X) = ⋃ {SH(x)| x ∈ X} = ⋃ {H(x)| x ∈ X} = H(X), which follows SH = H . Suppose β be any covering of U , then SH = ClP(β). According to Theorem 5, SH satisfies axioms (1H)-(4H); Moreover, by theorem 2 and theorem 3, SH also satisfies axiom (5H).\nRemark 3. It should be pointed out that the covering β is also not unique in the proof of sufficient condition. For example, the family of subsets {H(x)|x ∈ U} is chosen as the covering β in [20].\nThe third type of covering based rough approximation operators on finite universe was defined in [22], however, the upper and the lower approximation operator were not dual. In the following, we will discuss the third type of covering based upper approximation operator and its dual, and our results also apply to infinite universe [11].\nDefinition 9 ([22]). For any covering β of U , operators TH, TL : P (U) → P (U) are defined as follows: ∀X ⊆ U ,\nTH(X) = ⋃ { ↓x| x ∈ X}\nTL(X) = {x ∈ U | ∀u(x ∈↓u →↓u ⊆ X)} We call TH, TL the third type of covering upper and lower operators, respectively.\nProposition 13. For any covering β of U , ∀X ⊆ U , TH(X) = {x ∈ U | ↑x ⋂ X 6= ∅}\nTL(X) = {x ∈ U | ↑x ⊆ X}\nProof. For anyX ⊆ U , then TH(X) = ⋃ {↓y|y ∈ X} = {x ∈ U |∃y ∈ X(x ∈↓y)} = {x ∈ U | ↑x ⋂ X 6= ∅}. Dually, TL(X) = {x ∈ U | ↑x ⊆ X}.\nAccording to Theorem 1, ↑x = β(x), then operators TH and TL are in fact Cěch quasi-discrete closure and interior operators bijectively corresponding to the reflexive and transitive relation β .\nProposition 14. For any X ⊆ U , TH(X) = Cl β (X), TL(X) = Int β (X).\nTheorem 7. Let H : P (U) → P (U), X ⊆ U , Xi ⊆ U(∀i ∈ I), then H satisfies the following properties (H1)-(H4):\n(H1) H(∅) = ∅ (H2) X ⊆ H(X) (H3) H( ⋃ Xi) = ⋃ H(Xi)\n(H4) H(H(X)) = H(X) if and only if there exists a covering β such that H = TH.\nProof. For any covering β, TH = Cl β , which follows that TH satifies properties (H1)-(H4).\nSuppose H satisfies properties (H1)-(H4) and ∀x ∈ U By property (H2) then x ∈ H(x) holds, which follows that β = {H(u)| u ∈ U} is a covering of U . By property (H4), H(H(x)) = H(x) and ↓ x = ⋂ {H(y)| x ∈ H(y)} = H(x), so TH(x) = {y| ↑y ⋂ {x} 6= ∅} = {y| x ∈↑y} =↓x. For any X ⊆ U , by the quasidiscreteness of TH as well as the property (H3), then TH(X) = ⋃ {TH(x)| x ∈ X} = ⋃ {H(x)| x ∈ X} = H(X).\nThe fourth type of covering based rough approximation operators was defined in [15][23], and [4][14] discussed a special case in that the covering is precisely B(T ) of given tolerance relation T . In [11][15], it was proved that the fourth type of operators are equivalent to rough approximation operators based on preordering relation.\nDefinition 10 ([23]). For any covering β of U , operators XH,XL : P (U) → P (U) are defined as follows: ∀X ⊆ U ,\nXH(X) = {x ∈ U | ↓x ⋂ X 6= ∅}\nXL(X) = {x ∈ U | ↓x ⊆ X} We call XH, XL the fourth type of covering upper and lower operators, respectively.\nAccording to Theorem 1, ↓x = β (x), so we have the following topological interpretation of XH and XL.\nProposition 15. For any X ⊆ U , XH(X) = Cl β (X), XL(X) = Int β (X).\nTheorem 8. Let H : P (U) → P (U), ∀x, y ∈ U , X ⊆ U and Xi ⊆ U holds for any i of arbitrary index set I, then H satisfies properties (H1)-(H4) if and only if there exists a covering β such that H = XH.\nProof. Suppose H satisfies properties (H1)-(H4). Let β = {Kc|H(K) = K}, then β is a covering of U since H(∅) = ∅, and ∀x ∈ U , it is easy to verify that the point closure of x with respect to βc is precisely H(x), and that XH(x) =↑x, the core of x with respect to β, so XH(x) = H(x). For any X ⊆ U , by the quasidiscreteness of XH and property (H3), we have XH(X) =\n⋃ {XH(x)|x ∈ X} =⋃\n{H(x)| x ∈ X} = H(X).\nNote that the third and fourth types of upper approximation operators have the same axiomatic characterization, however, the corresponding coverings are different."

The paper understands these coverings as granular worlds at different abstraction level, and investigates typical properties of transformations among these granular worlds.\nAs an application of the presented multi-granular perspectives on covering, four types of covering based rough approximation operators are proved to be induced by binary relations, which, to some extent, bridges the gap between generalized rough sets based on binary relation and coverings. Furthermore, axiomaic characterizations of these four types of upper approximation operators are obtained, and these results can be dually apply to lower ones."

For any given covering, both intersection and union of covering blocks containing an element are exploited as granules to form granular worlds at different abstraction levels, respectively, and transformations among these different granular worlds are also discussed. As an application of the presented multi-granular perspective on covering, relational interpretation and axiomization of four types of covering based rough upper approximation operators are investigated, which can be dually applied",
