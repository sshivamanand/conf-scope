We prove that this approach yields accurate value estimates when we have either a good (but not necessarily consistent) model of rewards or a good (but not necessarily consistent) model of past policy. Extensive empirical comparison demonstrates that the doubly robust approach uniformly improves over existing techniques, achieving both lower variance in value estimation and better policies. As such, we expect the doubly robust approach to become common practice."

      "text" : "We study decision making in environments where we receive feedback only for chosen actions. For example, in Internet advertising, we find only whether a user clicked\nAppearing in Proceedings of the 28 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Bellevue, WA, USA, 2011. Copyright 2011 by the author(s)/owner(s).\non some of the presented ads, but receive no information about the ads that were not presented. In health care, we only find out success rates for patients who received the treatments, but not for the alternatives. Both of these problems are instances of contextual bandits (Auer et al., 2002; Langford & Zhang, 2008). The context refers to additional information about the user or patient. Here, we focus on the offline version: we assume access to historic data, but no ability to gather new data (Langford et al., 2008; Strehl et al., 2011).\nTwo kinds of approaches address offline learning in contextual bandits. The first, which we call the direct method (DM), estimates the reward function from given data and uses this estimate in place of actual reward to evaluate the policy value on a set of contexts. The second kind, called inverse propensity score (IPS) (Horvitz & Thompson, 1952), uses importance weighting to correct for the incorrect proportions of actions in the historic data. The first approach requires an accurate model of rewards, whereas the second approach requires an accurate model of the past policy. In general, it might be difficult to accurately model rewards, so the first assumption can be too restrictive. On the other hand, it is usually possible to model the past policy quite well. However, the second kind of approach often suffers from large variance especially when the past policy differs significantly from the policy being evaluated.\nIn this paper, we propose to use the technique of doubly robust (DR) estimation to overcome problems with the two existing approaches. Doubly robust (or doubly protected) estimation (Cassel et al., 1976; Robins et al., 1994; Robins & Rotnitzky, 1995; Lunceford & Davidian, 2004; Kang & Schafer, 2007) is a statistical approach for estimation from incomplete data with an important property: if either one of the two estimators (in DM and IPS) is correct, then the estimation is unbiased. This method thus increases the chances of drawing reliable inference.\nFor example, when conducting a survey, seemingly ancillary questions such as age, sex, and family income may be asked. Since not everyone contacted responds to the sur-\nvey, these values along with census statistics may be used to form an estimator of the probability of a response conditioned on age, sex, and family income. Using importance weighting inverse to these estimated probabilities, one estimator of overall opinions can be formed. An alternative estimator can be formed by directly regressing to predict the survey outcome given any available sources of information. Doubly robust estimation unifies these two techniques, so that unbiasedness is guaranteed if either the probability estimate is accurate or the regressed predictor is accurate.\nWe apply the doubly robust technique to policy value estimation in a contextual bandit setting. The core technique is analyzed in terms of bias in Section 3 and variance in Section 4. Unlike previous theoretical analyses, we do not assume that either the reward model or the past policy model are correct. Instead, we show how the deviations of the two models from the truth impact bias and variance of the doubly robust estimator. To our knowledge, this style of analysis is novel and may provide insights into doubly robust estimation beyond the specific setting studied here. In Section 5, we apply this method to both policy evaluation and optimization, finding that this approach substantially sharpens existing techniques."

      "text" : "Doubly robust estimation is widely used in statistical inference (see, e.g., Kang & Schafer (2007) and the references therein). More recently, it has been used in Internet advertising to estimate the effects of new features for online advertisers (Lambert & Pregibon, 2007; Chan et al., 2010). Previous work focuses on parameter estimation rather than policy evaluation/optimization, as addressed here. Furthermore, most of previous analysis of doubly robust estimation studies asymptotic behavior or relies on various modeling assumptions (e.g., Robins et al. (1994), Lunceford & Davidian (2004), and Kang & Schafer (2007)). Our analysis is non-asymptotic and makes no such assumptions.\nSeveral other papers in machine learning have used ideas related to the basic technique discussed here, although not with the same language. For benign bandits, Hazan & Kale (2009) construct algorithms which use reward estimators in order to achieve a worst-case regret that depends on the variance of the bandit rather than time. Similarly, the Offset Tree algorithm (Beygelzimer & Langford, 2009) can be thought of as using a crude reward estimate for the “offset”. In both cases, the algorithms and estimators described here are substantially more sophisticated."

      "text" : "Let X be an input space and A = {1, . . . , k} a finite action space. A contextual bandit problem is specified by a distri-\nbution D over pairs (x,~r) where x ∈ X is the context and ~r ∈ [0, 1]A is a vector of rewards. The input data has been generated using some unknown policy (possibly adaptive and randomized) as follows:\n• The world draws a new example (x,~r) ∼ D. Only x is revealed. • The policy chooses an action a ∼ p(a | x, h), where h is the history of previous observations (that is, the concatenation of all preceding contexts, actions and observed rewards). • Reward ra is revealed. It should be emphasized that other rewards ra′ with a′ 6= a are not observed.\nNote that neither the distribution D nor the policy p is known. Given a data set S = {(x, h, a, ra)} collected as above, we are interested in two tasks: policy evaluation and policy optimization. In policy evaluation, we are interested in estimating the value of a stationary policy π, defined as:\nV π = E(x,~r)∼D[rπ(x)] .\nOn the other hand, the goal of policy optimization is to find an optimal policy with maximum value: π∗ = argmaxπ V\nπ. In the theoretical sections of the paper, we treat the problem of policy evaluation. It is expected that better evaluation generally leads to better optimization (Strehl et al., 2011). In the experimental section, we study how our policy evaluation approach can be used for policy optimization in a classification setting."

      "text" : "The key challenge in estimating policy value, given the data as described in the previous section, is the fact that we only have partial information about the reward, hence we cannot directly simulate our proposed policy on the data set S. There are two common solutions for overcoming this limitation. The first, called direct method (DM), forms an estimate ˆ̺a(x) of the expected reward conditioned on the context and action. The policy value is then estimated by\nV̂ πDM = 1\n|S|\n∑\nx∈S\nˆ̺π(x)(x) .\nClearly, if ˆ̺a(x) is a good approximation of the true expected reward, defined as ̺a(x) = E(x,~r)∼D[ra | x], then the DM estimate is close to V π. Also, if ˆ̺ is unbiased, V̂ πDM is an unbiased estimate of V\nπ. A problem with this method is that the estimate ˆ̺ is formed without the knowledge of π and hence might focus on approximating ̺ mainly in the areas that are irrelevant for V π and not sufficiently in the areas that are important for V π; see Beygelzimer & Langford (2009) for a more refined analysis.\nThe second approach, called inverse propensity score (IPS), is typically less prone to problems with bias. Instead of\napproximating the reward, IPS forms an approximation p̂(a | x, h) of p(a | x, h), and uses this estimate to correct for the shift in action proportions between the old, datacollection policy and the new policy:\nV̂ πIPS = 1\n|S|\n∑\n(x,h,a,ra)∈S\nraI(π(x) = a)\np̂(a | x, h)\nwhere I(·) is an indicator function evaluating to one if its argument is true and zero otherwise. If p̂(a | x, h) ≈ p(a | x, h) then the IPS estimate above will be, approximately, an unbiased estimate of V π. Since we typically have a good (or even accurate) understanding of the datacollection policy, it is often easier to obtain a good estimate p̂, and thus IPS estimator is in practice less susceptible to problems with bias compared with the direct method. However, IPS typically has a much larger variance, due to the range of the random variable increasing. The issue becomes more severe when p(a | x, h) gets smaller. Our approach alleviates the large variance problem of IPS by taking advantage of the estimate ˆ̺ used by the direct method."

Here, we use a DR estimator of the form first suggested by Cassel et al.

(1)\nInformally, the estimator uses ˆ̺ as a baseline and if there is data available, a correction is applied. We will see that our estimator is accurate if at least one of the estimators, ˆ̺ and p̂, is accurate, hence the name doubly robust.\nIn practice, it is rare to have an accurate estimation of either ̺ or p. Thus, a basic question is: How does this estimator perform as the estimates ˆ̺ and p̂ deviate from the truth? The following two sections are dedicated to bias and variance analysis, respectively, of the DR estimator."

In our analysis, we assume that the estimates p̂ and ˆ̺ are fixed independently of S (e.g., by splitting the original data set into S and a separate portion for estimating p̂ and ˆ̺).

      "text" : "In the previous section, we argued that the expected value of V̂ πDR compares favorably with IPS and DM. In this section, we look at the variance of DR. Since large deviation\nbounds have a primary dependence on variance, a lower variance implies a faster convergence rate. We treat only the case with stationary past policy, and hence drop the dependence on h throughout.\nAs in the previous section, it suffices to analyze the second moment (and then variance) of a single term of Eq. (1). We use a similar decomposition as in Eq. (2). To simplify derivation we use the notation ε = (ra−̺a)I/p̂. Note that, conditioned on x and a, the expectation of ε is zero. Hence, we can write the second moment as\nEx,~r,a\n[(\n(ra − ˆ̺a)I\np̂ + ˆ̺π(x)\n)2]\n= Ex,~r,a[ε 2] +Ex[̺ 2 π(x)] + 2Ex,a\n[ ̺π(x)∆ ( 1− I/p̂ )]\n+Ex,a [ ∆2 ( 1− I/p̂ )2]\n= Ex,~r,a[ε 2] +Ex[̺ 2 π(x)] + 2Ex\n[ ̺π(x)∆δ ]\n+Ex [ ∆2 ( 1− 2p/p̂+ p/p̂2 )]\n= Ex,~r,a[ε 2] +Ex[̺ 2 π(x)] + 2Ex\n[ ̺π(x)∆δ ]\n+Ex [ ∆2 ( 1− 2p/p̂+ p2/p̂2 + p(1− p)/p̂2 )]\n= Ex,~r,a[ε 2] +Ex\n[( ̺π(x) +∆δ )2]\n+Ex [ ∆2 · p(1− p)/p̂2 ]\n= Ex,~r,a[ε 2] +Ex\n[( ̺π(x) +∆δ )2]\n+Ex\n[\n1− p\np ·∆2(1− δ)2\n]\n.\nSumming across all terms in Eq. (1) and combining with Theorem 1, we obtain the variance:\nTheorem 2 Let ∆, δ and ε be defined as above. If the past policy and the policy estimate are stationary, then the variance of the doubly robust estimator is\nVar [ V̂ πDR ]\n= 1\n|S|\n(\nEx,~r,a[ε 2] +Varx\n[ ̺π(x) +∆δ ]\n+Ex\n[\n1− p\np ·∆2(1 − δ)2\n])\n.\nThus, the variance can be decomposed into three terms. The first accounts for randomness in rewards. The second term is the variance of the estimator due to the randomness in x. And the last term can be viewed as the importance weighting penalty. A similar expression can be derived for the IPS estimator:\nVar [ V̂ πIPS ]\n= 1\n|S|\n(\nEx,~r,a[ε 2] +Varx\n[ ̺π(x) − ̺π(x)δ ]\n+Ex\n[\n1− p\np · ̺2π(x)(1 − δ) 2\n])\n.\nThe first term is identical, the second term will be of similar magnitude as the corresponding term of the DR estimator, provided that δ ≈ 0. However, the third term can be much larger for IPS if p(π(x) | x) ≪ 1 and |∆| is smaller than ̺π(x). In contrast, for the direct method, we obtain\nVar [ V̂ πDM ]\n= 1\n|S| Varx\n[ ̺π(x) +∆ ] .\nThus, the variance of the direct method does not have terms depending either on the past policy or the randomness in the rewards. This fact usually suffices to ensure that it is significantly lower than the variance of DR or IPS. However, as we mention in the previous section, the bias of the direct method is typically much larger, leading to larger errors in estimating policy value."

We chose a fixed time window in March 2010 and calculated the number of visits by each selected bcookie during this window. To summarize, the dataset contains N = 3854689 data: D = {(bi, xi, vi)}i=1,...,N , where bi is the i-th (unique) bcookie, xi is the corresponding binary feature vector, and vi is the number of visits.\nIf we can sample from D uniformly at random, the sample mean of vi will be an unbiased estimate of the true average number of user visits, which is 23.8 in this problem. However, in various situations, it may be difficult or impossible to ensure a uniform sampling scheme due to practical constraints, thus the sample mean may not reflect the true quantity of interest.

The whole process was repeated 100 times.\nThe DR estimator required building a reward model ˆ̺(x), which, given feature x, predicted the average number of visits. Again, least-squares ridge regression was used to fit a linear model ˆ̺(x) = w · x from sampled data.\nFig. 3 summarizes the estimation error of the two methods with increasing data size. For both IPS and DR, the estimation error goes down with more data. In terms of rmse,\nthe DR estimator is consistently better than IPS, especially when dataset size is smaller. The DR estimator often reduces the rmse by a fraction between 10% and 20%, and on average by 13.6%. By comparing to the bias and std metrics, it is clear that DR’s gain of accuracy came from a lower variance, which accelerated convergence of the estimator to the true value. These results confirm our analysis that DR tends to reduce variance provided that a reasonable reward estimator is available."

Training in a Filter Tree proceeds bottom-up, with each trained node filtering the examples observed by its parent until the entire tree is trained.\nTesting proceeds root-to-leaf, implying that the test time computation is logarithmic in the number of classes. We did not test the all-pairs Filter Tree, which has test time computation linear in the class count similar to DLM."

This setting, known as contextual bandits, encompasses a wide variety of applications including health-care policy and Internet advertising. A central task is evaluation of a new policy given historic data consisting of contexts, actions and received rewards. The key challenge is that the past data typically does not faithfully represent proportions of actions taken by a new policy. Previous approaches rely either on models of rewards or models of the past policy. The former are plagued by a large bias whereas the latter have a large variance. In this work, we leverage the strength and overcome the weaknesses of the two approaches by applying the doubly robust technique to the problems of policy evaluation and optimization. We prove that this approach yields accurate value estimates when we have either a good (but not necessarily consistent) model of rewards or a good (but not necessarily consistent) model of past policy. Extensive empirical comparison demonstrates that the doubly robust approach uniformly improves over existing techniques, achieving both lower variance in value estimation and better policies. As such, we expect the doubly robust approach to become common practice.",
