      "text" : "Regularization is a well studied problem in the context of neural networks. It is usually used to improve the generalization performance when the number of input samples is relatively small or heavily contaminated with noise. The regularization of a parametric model can be achieved in different manners some of which are early stopping (Morgan and Bourlard, 1990), weight decay or output smoothing, and are used to avoid overfitting during the training of the considered model. From a Bayesian point of view, many regularization techniques correspond to imposing certain prior distributions on model parameters (Krogh and Hertz, 1991). In this paper we propose a novel approach to achieve regularization that combines noise in the input and explicit output smoothing by regularizing the L2-norm of the Jacobian’s mapping function with respect to the input. Bishop (1995) has proved that the\nar X\niv :1\n10 4.\n32 50\nv1 [\ncs .A\nI] 1\n6 A\npr 2\ntwo approaches are essentially equivalent under some assumptions using a Taylor approximation up to the second order of the noisy objective function. Using his theoretical analysis, we derive the approximation of our cost function in the weak noise limit and show the advantage of our technique from the theoretical and empirical point of view. In particular, we show that we achieve a better smoothing of the output of the considered model with a little computational overhead."

Also our analysis assumes that the model’s output is scalar which will prevent the use of tensors for the low order terms of the Taylor expansion. We will use the following notations:\n• 〈., .〉 : inner product,\n• ⊗ : tensor product,\n• Jf (x), Hf (x), T (n) f (x) : respectively the Jacobian, Hessian and n-th order deriva-\ntive of f with respect to vector x.\nWe consider the following set of points: Dn = { zi = (xi, yi) ∈ (Rd,R)|∀i ∈ [[1;n]] } where the (xi, yi) are the (input,target) of an arbitrary dataset. In the paper we will consider a particular family of parametric models\nF = { Fθ ∈ C∞ ( Rd ) | θ ∈ Rp | p ∈ N } and Fθ(Rd) ⊆ R. We define the expected cost of the true distribution p(z) of our data points as being:\nC(θ) = ∫ L(z, θ)p(z)dz (1)\nThe expected empirical cost when using the data without noise can be expressed as: Cclean(θ) = ∫ L(z, θ)δ(zi − z)dz = 1\nn n∑ i L(zi, θ) (2)\nwhere δ is the Dirac function. When adding noise to the input, we will consider p(z) as being a parzen density estimator:\np(z) = 1\nn n∑ i ψ(zi − z) (3)\nwith the kernels ψ centered on the points of our dataset. In the rest of this paper we will consider kernels for which the following assumptions hold:\n(a) every kernel has zero mean,\n(b) different components of a kernel are independent.\nNote that the normal and uniform distribution have these properties. Using (a), we can write (An, 1996): ∀i, ∫ εiψ(ε)dε = 0 (4)\nand using (b) :\n∀(i, j), ∫ εiεjψ(ε)dε = σ 2δij (5)\nwhere σ is the variance of the distribution φ, and ε = (ε1, . . . , εd). In our analysis we will restrict ourselves to gaussian kernels:\nψ(zi − z) = Nzi,σ2(z) (6)\nSubstituting (6) in (3) we can write the objective function with noisy input as being:\nCnoisy(θ) = 1 n n∑ i ∫ L(z, θ)Nzi,σ2(z)dz (7)"

      "text" : "Bishop (1995) already showed that tuning the parameters of a model with corrupted inputs is asymptotically equivalent to minimizing the true error function when simultaneously decreasing the level of corruption to zero as the number of corrupted inputs tends to infinity. He also showed that adding noise in the input is equivalent to minimize a different objective function that includes one or more penalty terms, and he uses a Taylor expansion to derive an analytic approximation of the noise induced penalty. Using the above assumption we can write:\nCnoisy(θ) = Cclean(θ) + φ(θ) (8)\nwhere φ is the penalty term. Substituting (7) and (2) in (8) we express the penalty term as being:\nφ(θ) = 1\nn n∑ i [∫ L(z, θ)Nzi,σ2(z)dz − L(zi, θ) ] (9)\nWe define the noise vector as being ε = z− zi and omitting θ for simplicity we can write ∀i, the term inside the sum of (9):\nD = ∫ L(zi + ε)N0,σ2(ε)dε− L(zi) (10)\nNow that we have identified the term to approximate, let’s write the Taylor approximation of our loss function when our sample is shifted by a noise vector ε:\nL(z + ε) = L(z) + 〈JL(z), ε〉+ 1\n2 εT .HL(z).ε+ o(ε 2) (11)\nTo match equation (10) we multiply with (6) and integrate with respect to ε both sides of (11): ∫\nL(z + ε)N0,σ2(ε)dε =\n∫ [ L(z) + 〈JL(z), ε〉+ 1\n2 εT .HL(z).ε+ o(ε)\n] N0,σ2(ε)dε\n(12)\nEquation (4) implies that all odd-moments of the approximation are null and in conjunction with (5) we can now simplify (12) into:∫\nL(z + ε)N0,σ2(ε)dε\n= L(z) ∫ N0,σ2(ε)dε︸ ︷︷ ︸\n1\n+ ∫ 〈JL(z), ε〉N0σ2(ε)dε︸ ︷︷ ︸\n0\n+ 1\n2\n∫ εT .HL(z).εN0,σ2(ε)dε+R\n(13)\nand with some algebra we can finally write:∫ L(z + ε)N0,σ2(ε)dε− L(z) ≈ σ2\n2 Tr(HL(z)) (14)\nby substituting z = zi and summing over all the elements of Dn:\nφ(θ) ≈ σ 2\n2n n∑ i Tr(HL(zi)) (15)\nHence training with corrupted inputs is approximately equivalent to minimize the following objective:\nCnoise(θ) ≈ Cclean(θ) + λTr(HC̄(θ)) (16)\nThis relation holds for any objective C with the above two assumptions.\nAll the above results are already well established in the literature of noise injection (Bishop, 1995; An, 1996). Our contribution is to show that, for the second order Taylor expansion, adding noise to the input on a well chosen regularized objective is equivalent to add\na L2-norm on the Hessian of the output function of the considered model respectively to its input, which is not the case when adding noise to a non-regularized objective. In the following sections we will consider the MSE as the objective function to tune the parameters of our model but this choice does not affect the generality of our analysis."

      "text" : "We have tried several experiments in order to benchmark the effect of regularization and noise combined, for this task we used the well known MNIST (LeCun et al., 1998), MNIST binarised and the USPS database. Surprisingly, we were able to achieve results close to those obtained with unsupervised pretraining (Erhan et al., 2010). MNIST is composed of 70k handwritten digits represented by a vector of pixels. It is divided in 50k for the training set, 10k for each of the validation and test set, the range of the features were rescaled to be within [0, 1]. MNIST-Binary is divided exactly the same way as\nMNIST, the only difference is that the intensity of the pixels superior to 2552 where set to 1 and the others to 0. USPS dataset consists of a training set with 7291 images and a test set with 2007 images, the validation set was formed using the last 2000 images of the training set. The model F (x), with parameters θ = {W (1), . . . ,W (n), b(1), . . . , b(n)}, we considered to solve the classification task was a standard neural network with one or more hidden layers, and a hyperbolic tangent non-linearity in between the layers. For example, with one hidden layer we have:\nF (x) = σ(W (2) tanh(W (1).x+ b(1)) + b(2))\nwhere σ(.) is the logistic sigmoid function. In this setting we can write the Frobenius norm of the Jacobian of F with respect to x as being:\n||JF (x)||2 = ∑ i,j J2ij\nand with some calculus we get:\nJij = Fi(x)(1− Fi(x)) ∑ l W (2) il W (1) lj\n( 1− tanh2 (∑ m W (1) lm xm + b (1) l ))\nwhere Fi(x) is i-th output of the network. For the results in table (1), we used a number of hidden units ranging from 400 to 1000 per layer, the best results were obtained with two hidden layers on MNIST, and one hidden layer on MNIST-BINARY and USPS. The parameters of the model were learned through stochastic gradient descent with a learning rate ranging from 0.1 to 0.001. We also investigated the use of Rectifying units (i.e. max(0, x)) (Nair and Hinton, 2010; Glorot et al., 2010) as non-linearity in the hidden layer, surprisingly they seemed to benefit less from the added noise to the input than from the regularization term alone, they achieved a test classification performance of 4.8% on the USPS dataset equaling the best performance of the hyperbolic tangent activation with both regularization and added noise to the input. The best results where obtained with a gaussian isotropic noise with a standard deviation of 0.1 around training samples. Figure 1 shows the histograms of activation values on the MNIST test set of our best MLPs with and without Jacobian regularization. The activations of the regularized model are more densely distributed at the saturation and linear regime."

The proposed regularizer tries to avoid this scheme by flattening the mapping function over the training examples inducing a local\ninvariance in the mapping space to infinitesimal variance in the input space. Figure 2 shows that when the input is corrupted, the models learned with the regularization term are more robust to noise on the input. Geometrically, the added regularization imposes to the model to be a Lipschitz function or a contracting map around the training examples imposing the constraint F (x+ ε) ≈ F (x)."

To illustrate this point one can imagine that on the tip of a dirac function the norm of the jacobian is null and infinite just around it. Although this situation is not possible in the context of neural networks because of their smooth activation function. Given enough capacity we could converge to this solution if we do not add additional constraints. One of them would be to adjust the locality of the flatness as a hyper-parameter of the model. It requires to compute the higher order terms of the mapping function in order to regularize the magnitude of their norms. As it was discussed before, it is computationally expansive\nto explicitly calculate the norm of the high order derivatives because their number of components increases exponentially, instead our approach proposes an approximation of the Hessian term that allows you to simultaneously control the magnitude of both the Jacobian and hessian norms independently."

In a supervised setting, it is empirically feasible to drive those terms to zero because of the small dimensionality of the target points, whereas in a multidimensional regression task such as the reconstruction objective of an auto-encoder it is often impossible to achieve a “near” zero minimization of the cost with a first order optimization such as a stochastic gradient descent. The reader should note that the approximation of the noisy cost is valid when the number of corrupted inputs tends to infinity, though in practise this is never the case. It would be interesting to do an estimate of the difference between the terms induced by the noise and the real values of the term in function of the number of corrupted samples."

Using a Taylor expansion of the cost function, we also showed that by adding noise to the input of the regularization term we are able to penalize with a greater magnitude the norm of the higher order derivatives of the model avoiding the need to explicitly calculate them, which would be obviously computationally prohibitive. Initial results suggests that different parametric models clearly benefit from this approach in terms of predicting outof-sample points. It would be interesting to investigate how this regularization approach would behave when used with non-parametric models such as gaussian-mixtures."

    "abstractText" : "Regularization is a well studied problem in the context of neural networks. It is usually used to improve the generalization performance when the number of input samples is relatively small or heavily contaminated with noise. The regularization of a parametric model can be achieved in different manners some of which are early stopping (Morgan and Bourlard, 1990), weight decay, output smoothing that are used to avoid overfitting during the training of the considered model. From a Bayesian point of view, many regularization techniques correspond to imposing certain prior distributions on model parameters (Krogh and Hertz, 1991). Using Bishop’s approximation (Bishop, 1995) of the objective function when a restricted type of noise is added to the input of a parametric function, we derive the higher order terms of the Taylor expansion and analyze the coefficients of the regularization terms induced by the noisy input. In particular we study the effect of penalizing the Hessian of the mapping function with respect to the input in terms of generalization performance. We also show how we can control independently this coefficient by explicitly penalizing the Jacobian of the mapping function on corrupted inputs.",
