An entry ≤ k encodes that the respective reasoning problem is hard for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, i.e. either ΠP2 or ΣP2 hard, even when restricted to instances with distance to the specific graph class ≤ k.1 Respective for an entry 1 the problems maintain there full hardness even for instances with distance 1. An entry “fpt” denotes that the problem is fixedparameter tractable (cf. [9]) w.r.t. the distance to the specific graph class, which implies that there is no constant maintaining (full) hardness. Moreover for stage semantics, the class of noeven itself bears the full complexity, which is mirrored by the distance 0 entries in the table. Finally let us mention that [9] provides NP / coNP hardness results even for distance 1 to symmetric.\nThe remaining of the paper is organised as follows:\n• Section 2 introduces the necessary background. In particular we give the definition of argumentation frameworks and the related semantics.\n• In Section 3 we present our technical results, i.e. reductions showing hardness for specific graph classes.\n1We do not claim that these distances are optimal, it might be the case that ever lower distances suffices to obtain the full hardness."

      "text" : "In this section we introduce (abstract) argumentation frameworks [4] and recall the definitions of the semantics we study in this paper.\nDefinition 1. An argumentation framework (AF) is a pair F = (A,R) where A is a set of arguments and R ⊆ A × A is the attack relation. For a given AF F = (A,R) we use AF to denote the set A of its arguments and RF to denote its attack relation R. The pair (a, b) ∈ R means that a attacks b. We sometimes use the notation a R b instead of (a, b) ∈ R. For S ⊆ A and a ∈ A, we also write S R a (resp. a R S) in case there exists an argument b ∈ S, such that b R a (resp. a R b). In case no ambiguity arises, we use  instead of R.\nSemantics for argumentation frameworks are given via a function σ which assigns to each AF F = (A,R) a set σ(F ) ⊆ 2A of extensions. We shall consider here for σ the functions stb, adm, prf , com, grd , stg , and sem which stand for stable, admissible, preferred, complete, grounded, stage, and respectively, semistable semantics. Before giving the actual definitions for these semantics, we require a few more formal concepts.\nDefinition 2. Given an AF F = (A,R), an argument a ∈ A is defended (in F ), by a set S ⊆ A if for each b ∈ A, such that b  a, also S  b holds. Moreover, for a set S ⊆ A, we define the range of S, denoted as S+R , as the set S ∪{b | S  b}. We write S ≤+R E iff S + R ⊆ E + R .\nWe continue with the definitions of argumentation semantics.\nDefinition 3. Let F = (A,R) be an AF. A set S ⊆ A is conflict-free (in F ), if there are no a, b ∈ S, such that (a, b) ∈ R. For such a conflict-free set S, it holds that\n• S ∈ stb(F ), if S+R = A;\n• S ∈ adm(F ), if each a ∈ S is defended by S;\n• S ∈ prf (F ), if S ∈ adm(F ) and there is no T ∈ adm(F ) with T ⊃ S;\n• S ∈ com(F ), if S ∈ adm(F ) and for each a ∈ A that is defended by S, a ∈ S;\n• S ∈ grd(F ), if S ∈ com(F ) and there is no T ∈ com(F ) with T ⊂ S;\n• S ∈ stg(F ), if there is no conflict-free set T in F , such that T+R ⊃ S + R ;\n• S ∈ sem(F ), if S ∈ adm(F ) and there is no T ∈ adm(F ) with T+R ⊃ S + R .\nWe recall that for each AF F , stb(F ) ⊆ sem(F ) ⊆ prf (F ) ⊆ com(F ) ⊆ adm(F ) holds, and that for each of the considered semantics σ except stable semantics, σ(F ) 6= ∅ holds. The grounded semantics always yields exactly one extension. Moreover if an AF has at least one stable extension then its stable, semi-stable, and stage extensions coincide.\nNext we briefly recall results concerning the complexity of reasoning. We assume the reader is familiar with standard complexity theory and in particular with the polynomial hierarchy (see e.g. [10]). We are interested in the the following decision problems for the semantics σ on the second level of the polynomial hierarchy:\n• Credulous Acceptance Credσ: Given AF F = (A,R) and an argument a ∈ A. Is a contained in some S ∈ σ(F )?\n• Skeptical Acceptance Skeptσ: Given AF F = (A,R) and an argument a ∈ A. Is a contained in each S ∈ σ(F )?\nWe summarize the general complexity of the mentioned reasoning problems [1, 3, 6, 7] in Table 2.\nFinally we introduce the distance to graph class which is closely related to the notation of a backdoor (see [9]).\nDefinition 4. Let G be a graph class and F = (A,R) an AF. We define distG(F ) as the minimal number k such that there exists a set S ⊆ A with |S| = k and (A\\S,R∩(A\\S×A\\S)) ∈ G. If there is no such set S we define distG(F ) = ∞.\nFollowing [9], we study the graph classes of acyclic (ACY), even cycle-free (NOEVEN), symmetric (SYM) and bipartite (BIP) graphs. In particular we consider decision problems which are not fixed-parameter tractable w.r.t. the above introduced distance to a fragment and prove that the problems are hard for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy even for a fixed distance to a tractable fragment."

      "text" : "Most of the results in this section build on reductions from deciding whether a quantified Boolean formula (QBF) in a particular form is valid. More concrete we consider QBF ∀2 formulae, which are of the form ∀Y ∃X ϕ where X and Y are strings of propositional atoms and ϕ is a propositional formula over the atoms X ∪Y (we may assume that ϕ is in 3-CNF, ϕ is satisfiable or ϕ is monotone). We say that a QBF Φ = ∀Y ∃X ϕ is valid if for each MY ⊆ Y there exists an MX ⊆ X such that M = MY ∪ MX is a model of ϕ. The problem QSAT ∀ 2 , deciding whether a given QBF ∀2 formula is valid, is well-known to be Π P 2 -complete.\nReduction 1. Given a QBF Φ = ∀Y ∃X ϕ with ϕ being a monotone CNF, C being the set of positive clauses, C̄ being the set of negative clauses and X = Y ∪ Z. The AF F 1Φ = (A,R) is constructed as follows:\nA = {ϕ, b, b̄} ∪ C ∪ C̄ ∪X ∪ X̄\nR = {(c, ϕ) | c ∈ C ∪ C̄} ∪ {(ϕ, b), (ϕ, b̄)} ∪\n{(x, x̄), (x̄, x) | x ∈ X} ∪\n{(l, c), (c, l) | literal l occurs in c ∈ C ∪ C̄} ∪\n{(b, c) | c ∈ C} ∪ {(b̄, c̄) | c̄ ∈ C̄} ∪\n{(b, x̄) | x̄ ∈ X̄} ∪ {(b̄, x) | x ∈ X}\nFor an illustration of this reduction see Figure 1.\nLemma 1. For a monotoneQSAT 2∀ formulaΦ and the AF F 1 Φ the following holds:\n1. The arguments b, b, c ∈ C ∪ C are not contained in any admissible set of F 1Φ.\n2. For each set S ⊆ Y the set S ∪ Y \\ S is admissible in F 1Φ and each set E ( Y ∪ Y not of this form is not a preferred extension.\n3. For any preferred extension E of F 1Φ, if Φ 6∈ E then E = S ∪ Y \\ S for some S ⊆ Y .\n4. For any preferred extension E of F 1Φ, if Φ ∈ E then E ∩ (X ∪Y ) is a model of ϕ.\n5. If M is a model of ϕ then M∪(X ∪ Y ) \\M)∪{Φ} is a preferred extension of F 1Φ.\nProof. We prove each point separately:\n1. In order to obtain a contradiction let us assume that there exists an admissible set E containing an argument c ∈ C ∪ C. We have that c is either attacked by b or b, and as E is an admissible set it must contain an argument that defends c. However, Φ is the only argument that attacks b or b, thus Φ ∈ E. But as c attacks Φ this contradicts the conflict-freeness of E. Hence we conclude that no admissible set of F contains an argument from C ∪C.\nNext let us assume that there exists an admissible set E containing b or b. Then E defends b or b, respectively, and thus contains an argument attacking Φ. As the only arguments attacking Φ are those in the set C ∪ C this contradicts the above observation.\n2. As all attacks concerning arguments in Y ∪ Y are mutual attacks we conclude that a subset of Y ∪ Y is admissible if and only if it is conflict-free. One can see that the maximal conflict free subsets of Y ∪ Y are the sets\nS ∪ Y \\ S with S ⊆ Y . Hence we can conclude that (i) these sets are admissible, (ii) each admissible subset of Y ∪Y is either of the form S∪Y \\ S with S ⊆ Y or the subset of such a set, and (iii) no subset of such a set can be maximal admissible, i.e., preferred.\n3. As mentioned in (1) the arguments b, b, c ∈ C ∪ C are not contained in any admissible set. Further, since Φ 6∈ E we obtain that the arguments x ∈ X ∪ X are not defended by E and thus not contained in E. The only arguments that are left belong to Y ∪ Y and hence by (2) E = S ∪ Y \\ S.\n4. As Φ ∈ E it follows that each argument in C ∪C is attacked by E. Further as b, b 6∈ E each argument in C ∪C is attacked by an argument in E ∩ (X ∪ Y ∪X ∪ Y ). Thus by construction, E ∩ (X ∪ Y ) is a model of ϕ.\n5. Clearly M ∪ (X ∪ Y ) \\M) ∪ {Φ} is conflict-free. We have mutual attacks between arguments x ∈ X∪Y and the corresponding arguments x ∈ X∪Y . Hence all arguments in X∪Y ∪X∪Y are either in the set M∪(X ∪ Y ) \\M) or attacked by some argument from this set. Further, as M is a model of Φ, it follows by construction that the arguments M ∪ (X ∪ Y ) \\M attack all the arguments in C ∪ C and thus defend Φ. Finally the argument Φ attacks both b and b. That is, each argument of F either is in the set M ∪ (X ∪ Y ) \\M) ∪ {Φ} or attacked by an argument from this set. Hence the set M ∪ (X ∪ Y ) \\M) ∪ {Φ} is a stable extension of F , and thus also an preferred extension of F .\nProposition 1. A monotone QSAT 2∀ formula Φ is valid iff the argument Φ is skeptically accepted in F 1Φ with respect to prf .\nProof. We are first going to show that the formula Φ is valid only if the argument Φ is skeptically accepted in F with respect to prf . To this end we consider a valid formula Φ = ∀Y ∃Xϕ(X, Y ). In order to obtain a contradiction let us assume that there exists a preferred extension E such that Φ 6∈ E. Then we have that E = S ∪ Y \\ S for some S ⊆ Y . Using that the formula Φ is valid, we conclude that there exists a model M of ϕ such that S ( M . But then E ′ = M∪(X ∪ Y ) \\M)∪{Φ} is a preferred extension of F and E ( E ′, a contradiction.\nIt remains to show that the formula Φ is valid if the argument Φ is skeptically accepted in F with respect to prf . To this end let us assume that Φ is not valid, i.e., there exists an S ( Y which is not contained in any model of ϕ. Now let us\nconsider an arbitrary preferred extension E such that S ∪ Y \\ S ⊆ E. Such an E must exist as S ∪ Y \\ S is an admissible set. In order to obtain a contradiction we assume that Φ ∈ E. It follows that E ∩ (X ∪ Y ) is a model of ϕ containing S, a contradiction. Thus Φ 6∈ E and we conclude that E is a preferred extension that does not contain Φ. Hence the argument Φ is not skeptically accepted in F with respect to the preferred semantics.\nTheorem 1. The problem Skeptprf is Π P 2 -complete even for AFs F with distBIP (F ) = 1.\nProof. By Proposition 1 one can use F 1Φ to reduce the Π P 2 -hard problem, deciding whether a monotone QSAT 2∀ formula is valid to Skeptprf . Now mention that deleting the argument ϕ from the AF F 1Φ would result a bipartite AF.\nReduction 2. Given a QBF Φ = ∀Y ∃X ϕ with ϕ being a CNF, C being the set of clauses and X = Y ∪ Z. The AF F 2Φ = (A,R) is constructed as follows:\nA = {ϕ, b} ∪ C ∪ C̄ ∪X ∪ X̄\nR = {(c, ϕ) | c ∈ C} ∪ {(ϕ, b)} ∪\n{(x, x̄), (x̄, x) | x ∈ X} ∪\n{(l, c), (c, l) | literal l occurs in c ∈ C} ∪\n{(b, c) | c ∈ C ∪ C̄} ∪ {(b, x) | x ∈ X ∪ X̄}\nTheorem 2. The problem Skeptprf is Π P 2 -complete even for AFs F with distSYM(F ) = 2.\nProof sketch. One can show that F 2Φ (similar to Proposition 1) reduces the Π P 2 - hard problem, deciding whether a QSAT 2∀ formula is valid to Skeptprf . Furthermore deleting the arguments ϕ, b from the AF F 2Φ would result a symmetric AF.\nReduction 3. Given a QBF Φ = ∀Y ∃Z ϕ with ϕ being a monotone CNF, C being the set of positive clauses, C̄ being the set of negative clauses and X = Y ∪ Z. The AF F 3Φ = (A,R) is constructed as follows:\nAΦ = {ϕp, ϕn, ϕ̄, b, g} ∪ C ∪ C̄ ∪X ∪ X̄ ∪ Y ′ ∪ Ȳ ′\nRΦ = {〈c, ϕp〉 | c ∈ C} ∪ {〈c̄, ϕp〉 | c̄ ∈ C̄} ∪ {〈x, x̄〉 , 〈x̄, x〉 | x ∈ X} ∪\n{〈x, c〉 , 〈c, x〉 | x occurs in c} ∪ {〈x̄, c〉 , 〈c, x̄〉 | ¬x occurs in c}\n{〈y, y′〉 , 〈y′, y〉 , 〈ȳ, ȳ′〉 , 〈ȳ′, ȳ〉 | y ∈ Y } ∪ {(g, y′), (g, ȳ′) | y ∈ Y } ∪\n{〈ϕp, b〉 , 〈b, ϕp〉 , 〈g, g〉 , 〈g, b〉} ∪ {(g, c) | c ∈ C} ∪ {(ϕp, ϕ̄), (ϕ̄, ϕp)}\nFor an example, see Figure 3.\nProposition 2. For a monotone QBF Φ = ∀Y ∃Z ϕ with each clause containing an literal from Z ∪ Z̄, the following statements are equivalent\n1. Φ is valid.\n2. ϕp is skeptically accepted in F 3Φ w.r.t. semi-stable semantics.\n3. ϕ̄ is not credulously accepted in F 3Φ w.r.t. semi-stable semantics.\nProof sketch. (1) ⇔ (2): Notice that this reduction is a variation of the reduction presented in [7]. Recall that the candidates for being semi-stable extensions are the preferred extensions. We have that none of the arguments {g, b} ∪ C ∪ C̄ ∪ Y ′∪Ȳ ′ is acceptable for a semi-stable extension, as none of them can be defended. Moreover each E,E1, E2 ∈ prf (F 3Φ) satisfies:\n• y ∈ Y ⇒ |{y, ȳ} ∩ E| = 1\n• z ∈ Z ⇒ |{z, z̄} ∩ E| = 1\n• For y ∈ Y if y ∈ E1 and ȳ ∈ E2 then E1 6≤+ E2 and E2 6≤+ E1.\nSo each preferred extension corresponds to an true-assignment on Y ∪ Z, and each true-assignment to at least on preferred extension. Further we have that assignments that differ on Y , result preferred extensions with incomparable range.\n⇒: Let us assume that Φ = ∀Y ∃Z ϕ is valid and let us consider an E ∈ sem(F 3Φ). E give rise to an true-assignment MY = E ∩ Y on variables Y , by assumption we have that there exists MZ ⊆ Z such that MY ∪MZ is a model of ϕ. Then the set G = MY ∪Y \\MY ∪MZ∪Z \\MZ∪{ϕp, ϕn} is an admissible set with G+ = A \\ ({g}∪ (Y \\M ′Y )∪ M̄Y ′ ). One can easily show that no admissible set containing MY ∪Y \\MY has any of the arguments ({g}∪ (Y \\M ′Y )∪M̄Y ′ ) it its range and hence G is ≤+-maximal. As by assumption also E is ≤+-maximal we have E+ = G+ and as b ∈ E+ we have ϕ ∈ E.\n⇐: Let us assume that Φ = ∀Y ∃Z ϕ is not valid, i.e. there is an MY ⊆ Y such that there is no MZ ⊆ Z such that MY ∪MZ is a model of ϕ. We consider the set E = MY ∪Y \\MY ∪Z∪{ϕ̄, ϕn} which is admissible as each clause of C̄ contains at least one literal from Z. We have that E+ = A \\ ({g, b} ∪ (Y \\M ′Y ) ∪ M̄Y ′ ). Hence we have that E is semi-stable unless there exists an extension G with G+ = A \\ ({g} ∪ (Y \\ M ′Y ) ∪ M̄Y ′ ). Such a G must contain both ϕn and ϕp and thus attacks each c ∈ C ∪ C̄. Hence, by construction of F 3Φ, G would corresponds to a model MY ∪MZ of ϕ, a contradiction to our assumption that there is no MZ ⊆ Z. Thus E is a semi-stable extension with ϕ 6∈ E.\n(2) ⇔ (3): As ϕ̄ is only in conflict with ϕp for each E ∈ sem(F 3Φ) either ϕp ∈ E or ϕ̄ ∈ E holds.\nTheorem 3. The problem Cred sem is ΣP2 -complete and the problem Skeptsem is ΠP2 -complete even for AFs F with distBIP (F ) ≤ 1.\nProof. By Proposition 2 and the observation that for monotone QBFs the F 3Φ−{g} is bipartite.\nReduction 4. For a given QBF Φ = ∀Y ∃Zϕ(Y, Z), build the AF F 4Φ = (AΦ, RΦ) with\nAΦ = {ϕ, ϕ̄, b, g} ∪ C ∪X ∪ X̄ ∪ Y ′ ∪ Ȳ ′\nRΦ = {〈c, ϕ〉 | c ∈ C} ∪ {〈x, x̄〉 , 〈x̄, x〉 | x ∈ X} ∪\n{〈x, c〉 , 〈c, x〉 | x occurs in c} ∪ {〈x̄, c〉 , 〈c, x̄〉 | ¬x occurs in c}\n{〈y, y′〉 , 〈y′, y〉 , 〈ȳ, ȳ′〉 , 〈ȳ′, ȳ〉 | y ∈ Y }∪{〈ϕ, b〉 , 〈b, ϕ〉 , 〈g, g〉 , 〈g, b〉}\n∪{(g, y′), (g, ȳ′) | y ∈ Y } ∪ {(ϕ, ϕ̄), (ϕ̄, ϕ)}\nFor an example, see Figure 4.\nProposition 3. For a monotone QBF Φ = ∀Y ∃Z ϕ with each clause containing an literal from Z ∪ Z̄, the following statements are equivalent\n1. Φ is valid.\n2. ϕ is skeptically accepted in F 4Φ w.r.t. semi-stable semantics.\n3. ϕ̄ is not credulously accepted in F 4Φ w.r.t. semi-stable semantics.\nProof sketch. Notice that this reduction is a variation of the reduction presented in [7] and can be easily shown to be equivalent, using that the arguments {g, b} ∪ Y ′ ∪ Ȳ ′ are not acceptable w.r.t. semi-stable semantics.\nTheorem 4. The problem Cred sem is ΣP2 -complete and the problem Skeptsem is ΠP2 -complete even for AFs F with distSYM(F ) ≤ 2\nProof. By Proposition 3 and the observation that the F 4Φ − {ϕ, g} is symmetric.\nReduction 5. Let (ϕ, xα) be an instance for the MINSAT problem, i.e. ϕ is a propositional formula over atoms X in CNF and xα ∈ X . We assume an arbitrary order < on the clauses of ϕ. The AF Fϕ,xα = (A,R) is constructed as follows:\nA = {ϕ, b, q} ∪ C ∪X ∪ X̄ ∪ {Ec | c ∈ C}\nR = {(c, ϕ) | c ∈ C} ∪ {(ϕ, b), (b, b), (q, xα)} ∪\n{(x, x̄), (x̄, x) | x ∈ X} ∪\n{(l, c) | literal l occurs in c ∈ C} ∪\n{(Ec, a) | c ∈ C, a ∈ A \\ ({c, ϕ, b} ∪ {Ec′ : c ′ < c})}\nProposition 4. Given (ϕ, xα) the following statements are equivalent:\n1. The atom xα is in a minimal model of ϕ.\n2. The argument xα is credulously accepted in Fϕ,xα w.r.t. stage semantics.\n3. The argument q is not skeptically accepted in Fϕ,xα w.r.t. stage semantics.\nProof. (1) ⇔ (2) Recall that each stage extension is also a naive extensions, and hence we consider only naive extensions as candidates for stage extensions.\nFirst let us consider naive extensions of Fϕ,xα = (A,R) containing an argument Ec. For simplicity we enumerate the clauses c1, . . . , cm and the arguments E1, . . . , Em, according to the order < on the clauses. Now one can easily check that these naive extensions are given by {{Ei, ϕ, q}, {Ei, ci, q} | 1 ≤ i ≤ m}. Further we have that the arguments E1, . . . , Em are in conflict with each other but not attacked from any other argument. Thus when concerning the ≤+Rmaximality of the above naive extensions they only compete with each other but not with any other naive extension. Comparing the range of these extensions we get that stage extensions E such that for some i, Ei ∈ E are the following {{Ei, ϕ, q} | 1 ≤ i ≤ n} ∪ {{E1, c1, q}}.\nNow let us consider naive sets E such that for each 1 ≤ i ≤ m, Ei 6∈ E. As we already have stage extensions with {Ei, ci, q}+ = A \\ {b} and {Ei, ϕ, q}+ = A \\ ({ci, E1, . . . , Ei−1}) Clearly {E1, . . . , Em} ∩ E = ∅ and thus the only way for E being ≤+R-maximal is that {b, c1, . . . , cm} ⊆ E\n+. When b ∈ E+ then we have that ϕ ∈ E and hence for 1 ≤ i ≤ m ci 6∈ E. That is that {b, c1, . . . , cm} ⊆ E+ iff ϕ ∈ E and X∩E is a model of ϕ. Hence there is a one-to-one correspondence between\nmodels M of ϕ and candidates for stage extensionsM∪X \\M∪{ϕ}∪{q | if x 6∈ M} By the construction the range of each this candidate is clearly incomparable with the ranges of the already determined stage extensions {{Ei, ϕ, q} | 1 ≤ i ≤ n}∪{{E1, c1, q}}. and thus the ≤ +\nR-maximality of such a candidate only depends on the other candidates.\nIt remains to show that for two models M,N , M ⊆ N iff M ∪ X \\M ∪ {ϕ} ∪ {q | if x 6∈ M} ≥+R N ∪ X \\N ∪ {ϕ} ∪ {q | if x 6∈ N} For the “only if” direction consider M ⊆ N . We have that (M ∪ X \\M ∪ {ϕ} ∪ {q | if x 6∈ M})+ = A\\ (M̄ ∪{E1, . . . , Em})∪{q | if x 6∈ M} and (N ∪X \\N ∪{ϕ}∪{q | if x 6∈ N})+ = A \\ (N̄ ∪ {E1, . . . , Em}) ∪ {q | if x 6∈ M}. As by assumption M ⊆ N we finally have that A\\(M̄ ∪{E1, . . . , Em}) ⊇ A\\(N̄ ∪{E1, . . . , Em}). For the “if” part let us consider M 6⊆ N . Hence there is some x ∈ M such that x 6∈ N . But then we have that x̄ 6∈ (M ∪X \\M ∪ {ϕ} ∪ {q | if x 6∈ M})+ and x̄ ∈ (N ∪X \\N ∪{ϕ}∪{q | if x 6∈ N})+. That is that M ∪X \\M ∪{ϕ}∪{q | if x 6∈ M} 6≥+R N ∪X \\N ∪ {ϕ} ∪ {q | if x 6∈ N}.\n(2) ⇔ (3): As xα is the only argument which has a conflict with q we have that each naive extensions, and thus also each stage extension, either contains q or xα. Hence if q is in all stage extensions then xα is not credulously accepted and vice versa.\nTheorem 5. The problem Cred stg is ΣP2 -complete and the problem Skeptstg is ΠP2 -complete even for AFs without even-cycles.\nProof. Immediate by Proposition 4, the fact that Minsat is ΠP2 -complete [8] and the fact that FΦ,xα has no even length cycle.\nTheorem 6. The problem Cred stg is ΣP2 -complete and the problem Skeptstg is ΠP2 -complete even for AFs F with distACY (F ) = 1.\nProof. Immediate by Proposition 4, the fact that Minsat is ΠP2 -complete [8] and the fact that FΦ,xα contains just one cycle, i.e. the self-attacking argument b.\nReduction 6. Given a QBF 2∀ formula Φ = ∀Y ∃Zϕ, we define F 5 Φ = (A,R), where\nA = {ϕ, ϕ̄, b, u, v} ∪ C ∪ Y ∪ Ȳ ∪ Y ′ ∪ Ȳ ′ ∪ Z ∪ Z̄\nR = {(c, ϕ) | c ∈ C} ∪ {(ϕ, ϕ̄), (ϕ̄, ϕ), (ϕ, b), (b, b)} ∪\n{(x, x̄), (x̄, x) | x ∈ Y ∪ Z} ∪\n{(y, y′), (ȳ, ȳ′), (y′, y), (ȳ′, ȳ) | y ∈ Y } ∪\n{(l, c), (c, l) | literal l occurs in c ∈ C} ∪\n{(u, v), (v, v)} ∪ {(y′, u), (ȳ′, u) | y ∈ Y }\nProposition 5. Given a (monotone) QBF 2∀ formula Φ = ∀Y ∃Zϕ the following statements are equivalent:\n1. Φ is valid\n2. ϕ is skeptically accepted in F 5Φ w.r.t. stage semantics.\n3. ϕ̄ is not credulously accepted in F 5Φ w.r.t. stage semantics.\nProof sketch. Mention that F 5Φ is a modification of the reduction presented in [7]. (1) ⇔ (2) The candidates for being stage extension are ⊆-maximal conflictfree sets, we notate them as naive(F 5Φ). We have two classes of naive extensions, those containing the argument u and those not containing u, which are incomparable w.r.t. ≤+R which can be seen as follows. For E in first class we have v ∈ E + and either y′1 6∈ E + or ȳ′1 6∈ E\n+ while for E in the latter class v 6∈ E+ and y′1, ȳ ′ 1 ∈ E\n+. So let us first consider the extensions containing u then we have that all of the arguments Y ′ ∪ Ȳ are unacceptable and we end up with the same situation as in\n[7]. Using the results from [7] we have that Φ is valid iff ϕ is skeptically accepted in the stage extensions containing u.\nNow let us consider the extensions E with u /∈ E. If Φ is invalid the ϕ fails to be skeptically accepted in the first case anyway. Thus we restrict ourselves to the case where Φ is valid. Then ϕ has at least one model M ⊆ Y ∪ Z and we can construct the extension S = M ∪ (Y ∪ Z) \\M ∪ ((Y ∪ Z) \\ M)′ ∪ M̄ ′ ∪ {ϕ}. As M is model of ϕ we have that S+ = A \\ {v}. As no stage extension E with u /∈ E satisfies v ∈ E+, each of these extensions has E+ = S+ = A \\ {v}. By b ∈ E+ and ϕ being the only attacker of b we obtain ϕ ∈ E for each E. Hence ϕ is skeptically accepted.\n(2) ⇔ (3) as ϕ̄ is only in conflict with ϕ for each E ∈ stg(F 5Φ) either ϕ ∈ E or ϕ̄ ∈ E holds.\nTheorem 7. The problem Cred stg is ΣP2 -complete and the problem Skeptstg is ΠP2 -complete even for AFs F with distBIP (F ) ≤ 4\nProof. By Proposition 5 and the observation that for monotone QBFs the F 5Φ − {u, v, b, ϕ} is bipartite.\nTheorem 8. The problem Cred stg is ΣP2 -complete and the problem Skeptstg is ΠP2 -complete even for AFs F with distSYM(F ) ≤ 4\nProof. By Proposition 5 and the observation that the F 5Φ −{u, v, b, ϕ} is symmetric."
