      "text" : "Fuzziness and randomness are two distinct components of uncertainty. While fuzzy sets are a rigorous softening of random sets, many of the operations defined in fuzzy logic lack a complete formalism, and are not strongly supported by experimental evidence. On the other hand causal possibilistic networks (CPN) or possibilistic Bayesian networks provide an ultimately flexible inference mechanism based on certainty or possibility distribution principles. However, CPNs suffer from the overwhelmingly large conditional possibility tables with discrete variables likewise probabilistic networks namely Bayesian networks. Fuzzification of continuous or crisp variables reduces the size of conditional certainty tables (case of certain networks in witch we use certainty degrees instead of possibilities or probabilities) to practically acceptable levels and these tables exhaustively encompass all the intuitive and fuzzy rules for inference problems. In this way, we reach a new knowledge representing engine, called fuzzy certain Bayesian networks, which provides a rigorous formalism for inference under fuzziness and randomness. The main idea of our modeling system of uncertain and imprecise knowledge is inspired from [3] where the authors have extended Dubois and Prade's [2] definition about the possibility and necessity measures of classical propositions to the case of\nInternet and Information Technology in Modern Organizations: Challenges & Answers 827\nfuzzy propositions through fuzzy truth values [1]. A classical proposition is true in some possible worlds and false in the rest of possible worlds, while a fuzzy proposition Þ is true with respect to a possible world to a degree [3]. We model our uncertainty about the actual world by defining a fuzzy necessity distribution over all possible worlds to specify the degree of necessity that the actual world is in each certain world. More formally, we consider that each necessity degree associated to a propositional formula Þ is a fuzzy number mapping from an interval [β1,β2]⊆ [0 , 1] to [0 , 1] where [β1, β2] is given by expert. Here the exact necessity degree is not specified but we are \"certain\" that it belongs to the interval [β1, β2]. For each state (respectively for each formula), we associate a fuzzy necessity degree χ ∈ [β1, β2]. And then we map the fuzzy necessity distribution defined by a membership function µ (χ1). More formally: µ : [β1, β2] [0 1] (1) χ1 µ (χ1)\nFigure1 illustrates the structure of fuzzy certain Bayesian network with five nodes where nodes may receive fuzzy values. ℵ(*) is the associated fuzzy certainty (i.e. necessity) distribution. More explanation of necessity distribution and fuzzy logic will be presented in the second part of next section."

      "text" : "The fuzzy set theory was first presented by Zadeh [5]. In this theory, uncertainty has more to do with vague definitions of criteria than randomness. The basis of the fuzzy set theory is a membership function µ(x). This function describes the degree to which a certain statement is true [6]. For example, the statement ‘Jhon is tall’ can be more or less true. If we had a precise definition, such as ‘Jhon is tall if it has at least 1.75 of size’, the membership function would only have values 0 and 1, and fuzzy sets would not be needed. Otherwise, the membership function for a fuzzy set Â could be:\nµÂ : X → [0, 1]\nAnd µÂ(x) is interpreted as the degree of membership of element x in fuzzy set Â for each x∈ X."

Formally a possibility distribution is defined as : Π : Ω [0 1] (2) ω π(ω) Where the degree π(ω) represents the compatibility of ω with the available information (or beliefs) about the real world. By convention, π(ω)= 0 means that the interpretation ω is impossible, and π(ω) = 1 means that nothing prevents ω from being the real world. [7]. Given a possibility distribution π, two different ways of rank ordering formulae of the language are defined from this possibility distribution. This is obtained using two mappings grading, respectively, the possibility and the certainty of a formula p: • The possibility (or consistency) degree: ∏(p) = max ( π (ω) : ω ∈ [p]) (3) Which evaluates the extent to which p is consistent with the available beliefs expressed by [p]. It satisfies: ∀p, ∀q ∏(p∨ q) = max (∏ (p), ∏ (q)) (4) Analogously we can define the fuzzy possibility distribution as follow: • The fuzzy possibility (or consistency) degree: µ∏(p) (t) = max (π (ω) : ω ∈ [p] and µp(ω) = t) (5)\nInternet and Information Technology in Modern Organizations: Challenges & Answers 828\nWhere µp denotes the fuzzy set of possible worlds of p in Ω. ω is a possible world in Ω and t is the degree of truth. µ∏(p) can be viewed as the possibility measure of a set of possible worlds in which the truth degree of p is equivalent to t [3], i.e., ∀p, ∀q µ∏ (p∨ q) = max (µ∏(p), µ∏(q)) (6) • The necessity (or certainty, entailment) degree N(p) = 1 – ∏ (¬ p) (7) Which evaluates the extent to which p is entailed by the available beliefs. We have [13]: ∀p, ∀q N (p∧ q) = min (N (p), N (q)) (8) Based on [3], we can define our fuzzy necessity as follow: • The fuzzy necessity (or certainty, entailment) degree: µN(p)(t)(p) = 1 – µN(p) (t) (¬ p) (9) Witch satisfies: ∀p, ∀q µN (p∧ q) = min (µN(p), µN (q)) (10) In both systems (certainty distribution and fuzzy certainty distribution) the fuzzy statement: \"its almost sure that ϕ is ω (ω∈[ϕ])\" where [ϕ] denotes the set of models of ϕ, can be represented by certainty weighted formula of the form (ϕ,α) where ϕ is a classical propositional formula and α is the lower bound of necessity degree and can be interpreted as a crisp value in case of necessity distribution and as µN (χ)∈ [β1,β2] in the case of fuzzy necessity distribution."

Such a network is usually represented as a directed graph in which there is an edge from each of the parents to the conditioned variable (fig 2).

It offers an alternative to probabilistic causal network when numerical data are not available.\nLet V= {A1,A2,..An} a set of variables (i.e attributes or proprieties). The set of interpretations is the Cartesian product of all domains of attributes in V. When each attribute is binary, domains are denoted by Di={ai,¬ai}.

As the formal representation of the knowledge base, we use a set of certain formulae. We represent random variables with necessities weights. Formally a necessity valued knowledge base is defined as the set: ∑= {(ϕι , αi) , i = 1….m} (14) Where ϕι denotes a classical propositional formula, and αi denotes the lower bound of certainty (i.e necessity). We can represent the information contained in each node of a Bayesian network, as well as the quantitative information contained in the link matrices, if we can represent all the direct parent/child relations. We express the relation between each random variable and its parents over a class of networks with a collection of quantified formulae. The collection of formulae represents the relation between the random variable and its parents for any ground instantiation of the quantified variables. The network fragment consisting of a random variable and its parents with a set of formulae of the form (ϕ , α). We give next some definitions inspired from [9] and [10].

This is means that each redundant formula should be removed from the certain valued knowledge base since it can be deduced from the rest of formulae. Next, we describe the process that permit to deduce a certain valued knowledge base from a certain network.\nLet NG be a certain Bayesian network consisting of a set of labeled variables V= {A1,A2,..An}. Now let A be a binary variable and let (a ¬a) be its instances. Given the measure N(ai|ui) witch represents the local necessity degree associated with the variable A where ui ∈ UA is an instance of parents(ai).

      "text" : "Logical formulae with a weight strictly greater than a given levels (lower bounds of necessity degrees) are immune to inconsistency and can be safely used in deductive reasoning [11]. However in order to perform reasoning for both imprecise and uncertain information, two important issues should be addressed. First, any improvement of the possibility level for a piece of information can only be achieved at the expense of the specificity of the information; second the accorded levels to the causality explained in terms of rules (case of fuzzy logic) and conditional dependencies (case of Bayesian networks) are somewhat expensive due to the fact that these confidence level is somewhat critical. We propose so to combine these three approaches (Bayesian networks certainty distribution and fuzzy logic) to develop a method for uncertain and imprecise knowledge representation that may improve decision based systems. Our fuzzy beliefs are to emulate a certain Bayesian necessity measure. For simplicity each variable here has two states: the presence or absence of an entity. The belief that A is present takes the form of a fuzzy truth fA. The extent to witch the belief of variable state influences the state beliefs of parent\nor child is modelled by a fuzzy set membership function: one for each influence direction. Example: Let our certain network be as described in figure representing a Bayesian network in metastatic cancer.\nFig. 4 shows a Bayesian network representing the above cause and effect relationships. Table 2 lists the causal influences in terms of fuzzy certainty distributions. Each variable is characterized by an unknown necessity degree given the state of its parents. For instance: C ∈ [0, 1] represents the dichotomy between having a brain tumor and not having one, c denotes the assertion C = 1 or “Brain tumor is present”, and ¬c is the negation of c, namely, C =0. The root node, A, which has no parent, is characterized by its prior fuzzy certainty distribution. Example Le the conditional fuzzy necessities associated to the graph presented in figure 4 be as described in table 3. For reason of simplicity we kept here four nodes only as in the graph presented in figure 3.\nFor instance N(d| b,¬c) cannot be 0.1 as described in table 1 but rather is a fuzzy number say χ1 ∈[βD|BC1 , β D|BC2 ] where χ1 = ℵ(d| b,¬c) is the fuzzy necessity associated with the fuzzy formula (d| b,¬c) and is associated with a membership function µ ( χ1 ) supposed to be a triangular function (respectively µ can be trapezoid or other kind of functions). µ is represented as follow (figure 5):\nInternet and Information Technology in Modern Organizations: Challenges & Answers 831\nThen we can deduce the next possible representation of µ(χ1) as: µ(χ1) = k1 x (χ1 –βD|BC1) – k2 x (|χ1 – βD|BC2| + χ1 – α) Where:\n- α, k1 and k2 are two defined constants.. - | * | is the absolute value of term *\nThe above expression and figure mean that the interval of χ1 is [βD|BC1 , β D|BC2 ]. If χ1 = α then µ(χ1)=1, implying that the fuzzy necessity χ1 = α is the most possible situation. If χ1 ≥ β D|BC2 or χ1≤ βD|BC1 then µ(χ1) = 0, the possible manifestation of χ1."

      "text" : "The present paper pretended to be an attempt to show and understand partially the world complexity that is being increasingly observed, being a try to contribute to ordering and organizing it. The considered approach combined the fuzzy logic and possibilistic logic in a framework of causal networks, which makes it an efficient tool that models knowledge taking into account the expert's subjectivity, vagueness and imprecision. Certain Bayesian networks with fuzzy knowledge bases approach in a natural way gives us the subsethood of the evidence for each logical formula. Although the methodology proposed in this paper, is aimed and illustrated by some typical examples, the developed techniques require experimental results. A future work is to extend this representation by definition of efficient algorithms for locally inferences. A future work will consist also on validating this approach by applying methodologies developed here on a real problem of knowledge representation with large scale data."

This paper deals with different definitions and classifications of uncertainty, sources of uncertainty, and theories and methodologies presented to deal with uncertainty. Fuzzification of crisp certainty degrees to fuzzy variables improves the quality of the network and tends to bring smoothness and robustness in the network performance. The aim is to provide a new approach for decision under uncertainty that combines three methodologies: Bayesian networks certainty distribution and fuzzy logic. Within the framework proposed in this paper, we address the issue of extending the certain networks to a fuzzy certain networks in order to cope with a vagueness and limitations of existing models for decision under imprecise and uncertain knowledge",
