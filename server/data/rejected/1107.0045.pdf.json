      "text" : "As shown by Dung (1995), argumentation frameworks provide a unifying and powerful tool for the study of several formal systems developed for common-sense reasoning, as well as for giving a semantics to logic programs. Argumentation is based on the exchange and valuation of interacting arguments which support opinions and assertions. It can be applied, among others, in the legal domain, for collective decision support systems or for negotiation support.\nThe fundamental characteristic of an argumentation system is the interaction between arguments. In particular, a relation of attack may exist between arguments. For example, if the argument takes the form of a logical proof, arguments for a proposition and arguments against this proposition can be advanced. In that case, the attack relation relies on logical inconsistency.\nThe argumentation process is usually divided in two steps: a valuation of the relative strength of the arguments, followed by the selection of the most acceptable arguments.\nIn the valuation step, it is usual to distinguish two different types of valuations:\nintrinsic valuation: here, the value of an argument is independent of its interactions with the other arguments. This enables to simply express to what extent an argument increases the confidence in the statement it supports (see Pollock, 1992; Krause, Ambler, Elvang, & Fox, 1995; Parsons, 1997; Prakken & Sartor, 1997; Amgoud & Cayrol, 1998; Kohlas, Haenni, & Berzati, 2000; Pollock, 2001).\nc©2005 AI Access Foundation. All rights reserved.\nFor example, in the work of Krause et al. (1995), using the following knowledge base, composed of (formula, probability) pairs {(φ1, 0.8), (φ2, 0.8), (φ3, 0.8), ((φ1 ∧ φ2 → φ4), 1), ((φ1 ∧ φ3 → φ4), 1)}, two arguments can be produced1:\nA1 =< {φ1, φ2, (φ1 ∧ φ2 → φ4)}, φ4 > and A2 =< {φ1, φ3, (φ1 ∧ φ3 → φ4)}, φ4 >.\nBoth arguments have the same weight 0.8 × 0.8 × 1 = 0.64, and the formula φ4 has the weight 0.64 + 0.64− 0.512 = 0.7682. interaction-based valuation: here the value of an argument depends on its attackers (the arguments attacking it), the attackers of its attackers (the defenders), etc.3 Several approaches have been proposed along this line (see Dung, 1995; Amgoud & Cayrol, 1998; Jakobovits & Vermeir, 1999; Besnard & Hunter, 2001) which differ in the sets of values used. Usually, two values are considered. However, there are very few proposals which use more than two values (three values in Jakobovits & Vermeir, 1999, and an infinity of values in Besnard & Hunter, 2001). For example, in the work of Besnard and Hunter (2001), the set of values is the interval of the real line [0, 1]. In this case, with the set of arguments4 {A1, A2, A3} and considering that A1 attacks A2 which attacks A3, the value of the argument A1 (resp. A2, A3) is 1 (resp. 1 2 , 2 3).\nIntrinsic valuation and interaction-based valuation have often been used separately, according to the considered applications. Some recent works however consider a combination of both approaches (see Amgoud & Cayrol, 1998; Karacapilidis & Papadias, 2001; Pollock, 2001).\nConsidering now the selection of the more acceptable arguments, it is usual to distinguish two approaches:\nindividual acceptability : here, the acceptability of an argument depends only on its properties. For example, an argument can be said acceptable if and only if it does not have any attacker (in this case, only the interaction between arguments is considered, see Elvang-Goransson et al., 1993). In the context of an intrinsic valuation, an argument can also be said acceptable if and only if it is “better” than each of its attackers (see Amgoud & Cayrol, 1998).\ncollective acceptability: in this case, the acceptability of a set of arguments is explicitly defined. For example, to be acceptable, a set of arguments may not contain two\n1. Here, the arguments are under the form of an “Explanation-Conclusion Pair”. This is one possible way to compute arguments (see also Lin & Shoham, 1989; Vreeswijk, 1997; Pollock, 1992; Prakken & Sartor, 1997; Simari & Loui, 1992; Elvang-Goransson, Fox, & Krause, 1993; Kohlas et al., 2000; Amgoud & Cayrol, 2002). 2. Weights being probabilities, the weight of an argument is the probability of the conjunction of the formulae of the argument, and the weight of φ4 is the probability of the disjunction of A1 and A2. 3. Here, we consider only the interactions corresponding to attacks between arguments. There exist also some other types of interactions (for example, arguments which reinforce other arguments instead of attacking them, see Karacapilidis & Papadias, 2001; Verheij, 2002). For this kind of interaction, graduality has not been considered. 4. Here, the initial knowledge base is useless.\narguments such that one attacks the other (interactions between arguments are used). Dung’s (1995) framework is well suited for this kind of approach but allows only for a binary classification: the argument belongs or does not belong to an acceptable set.\nIt is clear that except for intrinsic valuations, most proposals do not allow for any gradual notion of valuation or acceptability (i.e. there is a low number of levels to describe values and the acceptability is usually binary). Our aim is therefore to introduce graduality in these two steps. However, the processes of valuation and of selection are often linked together. This is the case when the selection is done on the basis of the value of arguments5 or when the selection defines a binary valuation on arguments. We will therefore:\nfirst consider and discuss the general principles concerning the definition of a gradual interaction-based valuation and then define some valuation models in an abstract argumentation system,\nthen, introduce the notion of graduality in the definition of the acceptability using the previously defined gradual valuations, but also some more classical mechanisms.\nSome graduality has already been introduced in argumentation systems. For instance, in the work of Pollock (2001), degrees of justification for beliefs are computed. Arguments are sequences of conclusive and/or prima-facie inferences. Arguments are collected in a graph where a node represents the conclusion of an argument, a support link ties a node to nodes from which it is inferred, and an attack link indicates an attack between nodes. The degree of justification of a belief is computed from the strength of the arguments concluding that belief and the strength of the arguments concluding on an attacker of the belief. Our work takes place in a more abstract framework since we do not consider any argument structure. Our valuation models are based on interactions between arguments and directly apply to arguments. We use the framework defined by Dung (1995): a set of arguments and a binary attack relation between arguments. We also use a graphical representation of argumentation systems (see Section 2). The gradualisation of interaction-based valuations will be presented in Section 3. Then, in Section 4, we will consider different mechanisms leading to gradual acceptability, sometimes relying on the gradual valuations defined in Section 3. We will conclude in Section 5. All the proofs of the properties stated in Sections 3 and 4 will be given in Appendix A."

      "text" : "We consider the abstract framework introduced by Dung (1995). An argumentation system <A,R> is a set A of arguments and a binary relation R on A called an attack relation: consider Ai and Aj ∈ A, AiRAj means that Ai attacks Aj or Aj is attacked by Ai (also denoted by (Ai, Aj) ∈ R). 5. For example, using Besnard and Hunter’s (2001) valuation, we can decide that all the arguments whose\nvalue is > 0.5 are selected, because 0.5 is the mean value of the set of values; Another possibility, with different valuations (interaction-based or intrinsic), is to accept an argument when its value is better than the value of each of its attackers.\nAn argumentation system is well-founded if and only if there is no infinite sequence A0, A1, . . . , An, . . . such that ∀i, Ai ∈ A and Ai+1RAi. Here, we are not interested in the structure of the arguments and we consider an arbitrary attack relation.\nNotation: <A,R> defines a directed graph G called the attack graph. Consider A ∈ A, the set R−(A) is the set of the arguments attacking A6 and the set R+(A) is the set of the arguments attacked by A7.\nExample 1 The system <A = {A1, A2, A3, A4},R = {(A2, A3), (A4, A3), (A1, A2)}> defines the following graph G with the root8 A3:\nA3\nA4\nA1 A2\nDefinition 1 (Graphical representation of an argumentation system) Let G be the attack graph associated with the argumentation system <A,R>, we define:\nLeaf of the attack graph A leaf of G is an argument A ∈ A without attackers9.\nPath in the attack graph A path from A to B is a sequence of arguments C = A1 − . . .−An such that:\nA = A1, A1RA2, . . . , An−1RAn, An = B.\nThe length of the path is n − 1 (the number of edges that are used in the path) and will be denoted by lC.\nA special case is the path10 from A to A whose length is 0.\nThe set of paths from A to B will be denoted by C(A,B).\n6. R−(A) = {Ai ∈ A|AiRA}. 7. R+(A) = {Ai ∈ A|ARAi}. 8. The word “root” is used in an informal sense (it just means that there are in the graph some paths\nleading to this node). This term and other terms (leaf, branch, path, . . . ) which are used in this document are standard in graph theory but may have a different definition. They are usual terms in the argumentation domain. Please see Definition 1 in order to know their precise meaning in this document. These definitions simply take into account the fact that the directed edges of our graph link attackers to attacked argument). 9. A is a leaf iff R−(A) = ∅. 10. We will assume that there exists an infinity of such paths. This assumption greatly simplifies the handling\nof leaves later in the paper.\nDependence, independence, root-dependence of a path Consider 2 paths CA ∈ C(A1, An) and CB ∈ C(B1, Bm). These two paths will be said dependent iff ∃Ai ∈ CA, ∃Bj ∈ CB such that Ai = Bj. Otherwise they are independent.\nThese two paths will be said root-dependent in An iff An = Bm and ∀Ai 6= An ∈ CA, 6 ∃Bj ∈ CB such that Ai = Bj.\nCycles in the attack graph A cycle11 is a path C = A1− . . .−An −A1 such that ∀i, j ∈ [1, n], if i 6= j, then Ai 6= Aj. A cycle C is isolated iff ∀A ∈ C, 6 ∃B ∈ A such that BRA and B 6∈ C. Two cycles CA = A1− . . .−An −A1 and CB = B1− . . .−Bm −B1 are interconnected iff ∃i ∈ [1, n],∃j ∈ [1,m] such that Ai = Bj.\nWe use the notions of direct and indirect attackers and defenders. The notions introduced here are inspired by related definitions first introduced by Dung (1995) but are not strictly equivalent12.\nDefinition 2 (Direct/Indirect Attackers/Defenders of an argument) Consider A ∈ A:\nThe direct attackers of A are the elements of R−(A). The direct defenders of A are the direct attackers of the elements of R−(A). The indirect attackers of A are the elements Ai defined by: ∃C ∈ C(Ai, A) such that lC = 2k + 1, with k ≥ 1. the indirect defenders of A are the elements Ai defined by:\n∃C ∈ C(Ai, A) such that lC = 2k, with k ≥ 2.\nIf the argument A is an attacker (direct or indirect) of the argument B, we say that A attacks B (or that B is attacked by A). In the same way, if the argument A is a defender (direct or indirect) of the argument B, then A defends B (or B is defended by A).\nNote that an attacker can also be a defender (for example, if A1 attacks A2 which attacks A3, and A1 also attacks A3). In the same way, a direct attacker can be an indirect attacker (for example, if A1 attacks A2 which attacks A3 which attacks A4, and A1 also attacks A4) and the same thing may occur for the defenders.\nDefinition 3 (Attack branch and defence branch of an argument) Consider A ∈ A, an attack branch (resp. defence branch) for A is a path in G from a leaf to A whose length is odd (resp. even). We say that A is the root of an attack branch (resp. a defence branch).\n11. This definition of a cycle corresponds to the definition of an elementary cycle in graph theory (an elementary cycle does not contain 2 edges with the same initial extremity, or the same ending extremity). 12. In Dung’s (1995) work, direct attackers (resp. defenders) are also indirect attackers (resp. defenders) which is not true in our definitions.\nNote that this notion of defence is the basis of the usual notion of reinstatement (B attacks C, A attacks B and C is “reinstated” because of A). In this paper, reinstatement is taken into account indirectly, because the value of the argument C and the possibility for selecting C will be increased thanks to the presence of A. All these notions are illustrated on the following example:\nExample 2\nA1 A2\nA3A4\nB2\nC1 C2\nD2\nC3\nD1\nE1\nB1\nA\nOn this graph G, we can see:\na path from C2 to A whose length is 2 (C2 −B1 −A), 2 cycles A1−A3−A2−A1 and A1−A3−A4−A1, of length 3, which are not isolated (note that A1 − A3 − A2 − A1 − A3 −A4 −A1 is not a cycle with our definition), the two previous cycles are interconnected (in A1 and A3), the paths D1−C1−B1 and C3−B2−A are independent, the paths D1−C1−B1−A and C3−B2−A are root-dependent and the paths D1−C1−B1−A and C2−B1−A are dependent, D1, C2, E1 are the leaves of G, D1−C1−B1−A is an attack branch for A whose length is 3, C2 −B1 −A is a defence branch for A whose length is 2, C2, B1 and B2 are the direct attackers of A, C1, C2 (which is already a direct attacker of A) and C3 are the direct defenders of A,\nD1 and D2 are the two indirect attackers of A, E1 is the only indirect defender of A."

      "text" : "We consider two different valuation methods for taking into account the quality of attackers and defenders of an argument in order to define the value of an argument using only the interaction between arguments13:\nIn the first approach, the value of an argument only depends on the values of the direct attackers of this argument. Therefore, defenders are taken into account through the attackers. This approach is called local.\nIn the second approach, the value of an argument represents the set of all the attack and the defence branches for this argument. This approach is called global.\nThe main difference between these two approaches is illustrated by the following example:\nB\nD C1\nC2\nC’ B’\n13. We pursue a work initiated in (Cayrol & Lagasquie-Schiex, 2003c) and propose some improvements.\nIn the local approach, B has two direct attackers (C2 and C1) whereas B ′ has only one (C ′). Thus B′ is better than B (since B′ suffers one attack whereas B suffers two attacks). In the global approach, two branches (one of attack and one of defence) lead to B whereas only one branch of attack leads to B′. Thus B is better than B′ (since it has at least one defence whereas B′ has none). In this case, C1 loses its negative status of attacker, since it is in fact “carrying a defence” for B."

      "text" : "Some existing proposals can already be considered as examples of local valuations.\nIn Jakobovits and Vermeir’s (1999) approach, a labelling of a set of arguments assigns a status (accepted, rejected, undecided) to each argument using labels from the set {+,−, ?}. + (resp. −, ?) represents the “accepted” (resp. “rejected”, “undecided”) status. Intuitively, an argument labelled with ? is both supported and weakened.\nDefinition 4 (Jakobovits and Vermeir’s labellings, 1999) Let <A,R> be an argumentation system. A complete labelling of <A,R> is a function Lab : A → {+, ?,−} such that:\n1. If Lab(A) ∈ {?,−} then ∃B ∈ R−(A) such that Lab(B) ∈ {+, ?}\n2. If Lab(A) ∈ {+, ?} then ∀B ∈ R−(A) ∪R+(A), Lab(B) ∈ {?,−}\nThe underlying intuition is that an argument can only be weakened (label − or ?) if one of its direct attackers is supported (condition 1); an argument can get a support only if all its direct attackers are weakened and an argument which is supported (label + or ?) weakens the arguments it attacks (condition 2). So:\nIf A has no attacker Lab(A) = +. If Lab(A) =? then ∃B ∈ R−(A) such that Lab(B) =?. If (∀B ∈ R−(A), Lab(B) = −) then Lab(A) = +. If Lab(A) = + then ∀B ∈ R−(A) ∪R+(A), Lab(B) = −.\nEvery argumentation system can be completely labelled. The associated semantics is that S is an acceptable set of arguments iff there exists a complete labelling Lab of <A,R> such that S = {A|Lab(A) = +}. Other types of labellings are introduced by Jakobovits and Vermeir (1999) among which the so-called “rooted labelling” which induces a corresponding “rooted” semantics. The idea is to reject only the arguments attacked by accepted arguments: an attack by an “undecided” argument is not rooted since an “undecided” attacker may become rejected.\nDefinition 5 (Jakobovits and Vermeir’s labellings, 1999 – continuation) The complete labelling Lab is rooted iff ∀A ∈ A, if Lab(A) = − then ∃B ∈ R−(A) such that Lab(B) = +.\nThe rooted semantics enables to clarify the links between all the other semantics introduced by Jakobovits and Vermeir (1999) and some semantics introduced by Dung (1995).\nExample 3 On the following example: An An−1 A2 A1\nFor n even, we obtain Lab(An) = Lab(An−2) = . . . = Lab(A2) = + and Lab(An−1) = Lab(An−3) = . . . = Lab(A1) = −. For n odd, we obtain Lab(An) = Lab(An−2) = . . . = Lab(A1) = + and Lab(An−1) = Lab(An−3) = . . . = Lab(A2) = −\nAnother type of local valuation has been introduced recently by Besnard and Hunter (2001) for “deductive” arguments. The approach can be characterised as follows. An argument is structured as a pair 〈support, conclusion〉, where support is a consistent set of formulae that enables to prove the formula conclusion. The attack relation considered here is strict and cycles are not allowed. The notion of a “tree of arguments” allows a concise and exhaustive representation of attackers and defenders of a given argument, root of the tree. A function, called a “categoriser”, assigns a value to a tree of arguments. This value represents the relative strength of an argument (root of the tree) given all its attackers and defenders. Another function, called an “accumulator”, synthesises the values assigned to all the argument trees whose root is an argument for (resp. against) a given conclusion. The phase of categorisation therefore corresponds to an interaction-based valuation. Besnard and Hunter (2001) introduce the following function Cat:\nif R−(A) = ∅, then Cat(A) = 1 if R−(A) 6= ∅ with R−(A) = {A1, . . . , An}, Cat(A) = 11+Cat(A1)+...+Cat(An)\nIntuitively, the larger the number of direct attackers of an argument, the lower its value. The larger the number of defenders of an argument, the larger its value.\nExample 3 (continuation) We obtain: Cat(An) = 1, Cat(An−1) = 0.5, Cat(An−2) = 0.66, Cat(An−3) = 0.6, . . . , and Cat(A1) = ( √ 5− 1)/2 when n → ∞ (this value is the inverse of the golden ratio14). So, we have: If n is even Cat(An−1) ≤ . . . ≤ Cat(A3) ≤ Cat(A1) ≤ Cat(A2) ≤ . . . ≤ Cat(An) = 1 If n is odd Cat(An−1) ≤ . . . ≤ Cat(A2) ≤ Cat(A1) ≤ Cat(A3) ≤ . . . ≤ Cat(An) = 1\nOur approach for local valuations is a generalisation of these two previous proposals in the sense that Besnard and Hunter’s (2001) Cat function and Jakobovits and Vermeir’s (1999) labellings are instances of our approach. The main idea is that the value of an argument is obtained with the composition of two functions:\none for aggregating the values of all the direct attackers of the argument; so, this function computes the value of the “direct attack”;\nthe other for computing the effect of the “direct attack” on the value of the argument: if the value of the “direct attack” increases then the value of this argument decreases, if the value of the “direct attack” decreases then the value of this argument increases.\n14. The golden ratio is a famous number since the antiquity which has several interesting properties in several domains (architecture, for example).\nLet (W,≥) be a totally ordered set with a minimum element (VMin) and a subset V of W , that contains VMin and with a maximum element VMax.\nDefinition 6 (Generic gradual valuation) Let <A,R> be an argumentation system. A valuation is a function v : A → V such that:\n1. ∀A ∈ A, v(A) ≥ VMin\n2. ∀A ∈ A, if R−(A) = ∅, then v(A) = VMax\n3. ∀A ∈ A, if R−(A) = {A1, . . . , An} 6= ∅, then v(A) = g(h(v(A1), . . . , v(An)))\nwith h : V ∗ → W such that (V ∗ denotes the set of all finite sequences of elements of V )\nh(x) = x\nh() = VMin For any permutation (xi1, . . . , xin) of (x1, . . . , xn), h(xi1, . . . , xin) = h(x1, . . . , xn) h(x1, . . . , xn, xn+1) ≥ h(x1, . . . , xn) if xi ≥ x′i then h(x1, . . . , xi, . . . , xn) ≥ h(x1, . . . , x′i, . . . , xn)\nand g : W → V such that\ng(VMin) = VMax g(VMax) < VMax g is non-increasing (if x ≤ y then g(x) ≥ g(y))\nNote that h(x1, . . . , xn) ≥ max(x1, . . . , xn) is a logical consequence of the properties of the function h. A first property on the function g explains the behaviour of the local valuation in the case of an argument which is the root of only one branch (like in Example 3):\nProperty 1 The function g satisfies for all n ≥ 1:\ng(VMax) ≤ g3(VMax) ≤ . . . ≤ g2n+1(VMax) ≤ g2n(VMax) ≤ . . . ≤ g2(VMax) ≤ VMax\nMoreover, if g is strictly non-increasing and g(VMax) > VMin, the previous inequalities become strict.\nA second property shows that the local valuation induces an ordering relation on arguments:\nProperty 2 (Complete preordering) Let v be a valuation in the sense of Definition 6. v induces a complete15 preordering on the set of arguments A defined by: A B iff v(A) ≥ v(B).\nA third property handles the cycles:\n15. A complete preordering on A means that any two elements of A are comparable.\nProperty 3 (Value in a cycle) Let C be an isolated cycle of the attack graph, whose length is n. If n is odd, all the arguments of the cycle have the same value and this value is a fixpoint of the function g. If n is even, the value of each argument of the cycle is a fixpoint of the function gn.\nThe following property shows the underlying principles satisfied by all the local valuations defined according to our schema:\nProperty 4 (Underlying principles) The gradual valuation given by Definition 6 respects the following principles:\nP1 The valuation is maximal for an argument without attackers and non maximal for an attacked and undefended argument.\nP2 The valuation of an argument is a function of the valuation of its direct attackers (the “direct attack”).\nP3 The valuation of an argument is a non-increasing function of the valuation of the “direct attack”.\nP4 Each attacker of an argument contributes to the increase of the valuation of the “direct attack” for this argument.\nThe last properties explain why Jakobovits and Vermeir (1999) and Besnard and Hunter (2001) propose instances of the local valuation described in Definition 6:\nProperty 5 (Link with Jakobovits & Vermeir, 1999) Every rooted labelling of <A,R> in the sense of Jakobovits and Vermeir (1999) can be defined as an instance of the generic valuation such that:\nV = W = {−, ?,+} with − < ? < +, VMin = −, VMax = +, g defined by g(−) = +, g(+) = −, g(?) =? and h is the function max.\nProperty 6 (Link with Besnard & Hunter, 2001) The gradual valuation of Besnard and Hunter (2001) can be defined as an instance of the generic valuation such that:\nV = [0, 1], W = [0,∞[, VMin = 0, VMax = 1, g : W → V defined by g(x) = 11+x and h defined by h(x1, . . . , xn) = x1 + . . .+ xn.\nNote that, in the work of Besnard and Hunter (2001), the valued graphs are acyclic. However, it is easy to show that the valuation proposed by Besnard and Hunter (2001) can be generalised to graphs with cycles (in this case, we must solve second degree equations – see Example 5).\nExample 4 Consider the following graph:\nB1 B2 B3 B4\nA\nD1 D2 D3\nC1 C3 C4C2\nE1\nIn this example, with the generic valuation, we obtain:\nv(E1) = v(D2) = v(D3) = v(C4) = v(B4) = VMax v(D1) = v(C2) = v(C3) = v(B3) = g(VMax) v(C1) = v(B2) = g 2(VMax) v(B1) = g(h(g 2(VMax), g(VMax))) v(A) = g(h(g(h(g2(VMax), g(VMax))), g 2(VMax), g(VMax), VMax))\nSo, we have: E1, D2, D3, C4, B4\nC1, B2\nD1, C2, C3, B3\nHowever, the constraints on v(A) and v(B1) are insufficient to compare A and B1 with the other arguments. The same problem exists if we reduce the example to the hatched part of the graph in the previous figure; we obtain E1, D2 C1 D1, C2, but A and B1 cannot be compared with the other arguments16. Now, we use the instance of the generic valuation proposed by Besnard and Hunter (2001):\nv(E1) = v(D2) = v(D3) = v(C4) = v(B4) = 1, v(D1) = v(C2) = v(C3) = v(B3) = 1 2 , v(C1) = v(B2) = 2 3 ,\n16. v(A) = g2(h(g2(VMax, g(VMax))) and v(B1) = g(h(g 2(VMax), g(VMax))).\nv(B1) = 6 13 , v(A) = 78283 .\nSo, we have: E1, D2, D3, C4, B4\nC1, B2\nD1, C2, C3, B3\nB1 A\nHowever, if we reduce the example to the hatched part of the graph, then the value of A is 13 19 . So, v(A) is better than v(B1) and v(D1), but also than v(C1) (A becomes better than its defender).\nExample 5 (Isolated cycle) Consider the following graph reduced to an isolated cycle:\nB\nA\n.\nA generic valuation gives v(A) = v(B) = fixpoint of g2. If we use the instance proposed by Besnard and Hunter (2001), v(A) and v(B) are solutions of the following second degree equation: x2 + x− 1 = 0. So, we obtain: v(A) = v(B) = −1+ √ 5\n2 ≈ 0.618 (the inverse of the golden ratio again)."

In this approach, the main constraint is that we must be able to identify the branches leading to the argument and to compute their lengths. This is very easy in the case of an acyclic graph.

The tuple (1, . . . , 1, . . .) ︸ ︷︷ ︸\n∞\nwill be denoted by 1∞.\nNotation 1 T denotes the set of the tuples built with positive integers.\nDefinition 8 (Operations on the tuples) We have two kinds of operations on tuples:\nthe concatenation of two tuples is defined by the function ⋆ : T × T → T such that\n0∞ ⋆ t = t ⋆ 0∞ = t for t 6= () (x1, . . . , xn, . . .) ⋆ (x ′ 1, . . . , x ′ n, . . .) = Sort(x1, . . . , xn, . . . , x ′ 1, . . . , x ′ n, . . .)\nSort being the function which orders a tuple by increasing values. the addition of a tuple and an integer is defined by the function ⊕ : T ×N→ T such that\n0∞ ⊕ k = (k) ()⊕ k = ()\n(x1, . . . , xn)⊕ k = (x1 + k, . . . , xn + k) (x1, . . . , xn, . . .)⊕ k = (x1 + k, . . . , xn + k, . . .) if (x1, . . . , xn, . . .) 6= 0∞\nNote that we allow infinite tuples, among other reasons, because they are needed later in order to compute the ordering relations described in Section 3.2.4 (in particular when the graph is cyclic). The operations on the tuples have the following properties:\nProperty 7 (Properties of ⋆ and ⊕) The concatenation ⋆ is commutative and associative. For any tuple t and any integers k and k′, (t⊕ k)⊕ k′ = t⊕ (k + k′). For any integer k and any tuples t and t′ different from 0∞17, (t ⋆ t′)⊕k = (t⊕k) ⋆ (t′⊕k).\nIn order to valuate the arguments, we split the set of the lengths of the branches leading to the argument in two subsets, one for the lengths of defence branches (even integers) and the other one for the lengths of attack branches (odd integers). This is captured by the notion of tupled values:\nDefinition 9 (Tupled value) A tupled value is a pair of tuples vt = [vtp, vti] with:\nvtp is a tuple of even integers ordered by increased values; this tuple is called the even component of vt;\nvti is a tuple of odd integers ordered by increased values; this tuple is called the odd component of vt.\n17. Otherwise it is false : (0∞ ⋆ (p))⊕ k = (p+ k), whereas (0∞ ⊕ k) ⋆ ((p)⊕ k) = (k) ⋆ (p+ k) = (k, p+ k).\nNotation 2 V denotes the subset of T × T of all tupled values (so, ∀vt ∈ V, vt is a pair of tuples satisfying Definition 9).\nUsing this notion of tupled-values, we can define the computation process of the gradual valuation with tuples18 in the case of acyclic graphs.\nDefinition 10 (Valuation with tuples for acyclic graphs) Let <A,R> be an argumentation system without cycles. A valuation with tuples is a function v : A → V such that:\nIf A ∈ A is a leaf then v(A) = [0∞, ()].\nIf A ∈ A has direct attackers denoted by B1, . . . , Bn, . . . then\nv(A) = [vp(A), vi(A)] with: vp(A) = (vi(B1)⊕1)⋆. . .⋆(vi(Bn)⊕1)⋆. . . vi(A) = (vp(B1)⊕1)⋆. . .⋆(vp(Bn)⊕1)⋆. . .\nNotes: The choice of the value [0∞, ()] for the leaves is justified by the fact that the value of an argument memorises all the lengths of the branches leading to the argument. Using the same constraint, either vp(A) or vi(A) may be empty but not both 19. Note also that the set of the direct attackers of an argument can be infinite (this property will be used when we take into account an argumentation graph with cycles).\nExample 6 On this graph, the valuation with tuples gives the following results:\nB2\nC1 C2\nD2\nC3\nD1\nE1\nB1\nA On this graph G, we have:\nv(D1) = v(C2) = v(E1) = [0 ∞, ()], v(C1) = v(D2) = [(), (1)], v(C3) = [(2), ()], v(B1) = [(2), (1)], v(B2) = [(), (3)], v(A) = [(2, 4), (1, 3)].\n18. This definition is different from the definition given in (Cayrol & Lagasquie-Schiex, 2003c). The ideas are the same but the formalisation is different. 19. The proof is the following:.\nIf A is not a leaf, at least one of the tuples is not empty, because there exists at least one branch whose length is > 0 leading to A (see Definitions 8 and 10). And, if A is a leaf, there also exists at least one defence branch because the path from A to A is allowed and its length is 0 (in fact, there are an infinity of such paths – see Definition 1) and no attack branch leading to the leaf (see Definition 10).\nSo, the value of a leaf is [0∞, ()], and it is impossible that vp(A) = vi(A) = ()."

As in Example 7, we can consider either that there is only one infinite branch (so, it is impossible to know if this branch is an attack or a defence branch), or that there is an infinity of attack branches and defence branches whose lengths are known and finite.

For each odd integer p, p belongs to each tuple yi, i ≥ 1.\nThe proof is done by induction on p.\nSo, v(A) = v(B) = [(2, 4, 6, . . .), (1, 3, 5, . . .)]. Then, v(C) = [(2, 4, 6, . . .), (3, 5, 7, . . .)].\nNote that all the above results can be readily extended to an unattacked cycle of length n, n ≥ 2.\nProperty 8 (Properties of unattacked cycles) For each unattacked cycle, for each argument A of the cycle, v(A) = [(2, 4, 6, . . .), (1, 3, 5, . . .)].\nExample 8 – Attacked cycle (continuation) Consider the following graph:\nA B\nD\nC E\nThe rewriting of this graph has been given in Section 3.2.2.\nDefinition 10 produces:\nvp(A) = (vi(D)⊕ 1) ⋆ (vi(A21)⊕ 1) ⋆ . . . ⋆ (vi(A2n1 )⊕ 1) ⋆ . . .\nvi(A) = (vp(D)⊕ 1) ⋆ (vp(A21)⊕ 1) ⋆ . . . ⋆ (vp(A2n1 )⊕ 1) ⋆ . . . and also\nv(D) = [0∞, ()]\nv(Ann) = [(), (1)] for each n ≥ 2\nAs done in the treatment of Example 7, the formulae giving vp(A) and vi(A) can be rewritten in order to bring to light some interesting sequences of tuples.\nx′k = (vi(A 2k 2k−1)⊕ 1) ⋆ . . . ⋆ (vi(A 2(k+p) 2k−1 )⊕ 1) ⋆ . . .\ny′k = (1) ⋆ (vp(A 2k 2k−1)⊕ 1) ⋆ . . . ⋆ (vp(A 2(k+p) 2k−1 )⊕ 1) ⋆ . . .\nThen, it is easy to prove that vp(A) = x ′ 1 and for each k ≥ 1, x′k = (x′k+1 ⊕ 2).\nSimilarly, vi(A) = y ′ 1 and for each k ≥ 1, y′k = (1) ⋆ (y′k+1 ⊕ 2).\nThe first equation enables to prove that x′1 is the empty tuple 21.\nThe second equation has already been solved and produces y′1 = (1, 3, 5, . . .).\nSo, v(A) = [(), (1, 3, 5, . . .)].

In appendix B, we introduce an algorithm for computing these tupled values. It uses a process of value propagation and is parameterised by a maximum “number of runs through a cycle”. This number will be used in order to stop the propagation mechanism and to obtain finite (thus incomplete) tupled values."

      "heading" : "3.2.4 Comparison of tupled values",
      "text" : "In this section, we define the comparison relation between arguments (so, between some particular tupled values), using the following idea: an argument A is better than an argument B iff A has a better defence (for it) and a lower attack (against it). The first idea is to use a lexicographic ordering on the tuples. This lexicographic ordering denoted by ≤lex∞ on T is defined by: 21. The proof is the following:.\nx′1 contains only even integers. For each k, x′k 6= 0 ∞ since x′k is the result of the addition of a tuple and an integer. If x′1 is not empty, let e1 denote the least even integer present in x ′ 1. As x ′ 1 = x ′ 2 ⊕ 2, x ′\n2 is not empty and e2 will denote the least integer present in x ′\n2. We have e1 = e2 + 2. So, we are able to build a sequence of positive even integers e1, e2, . . ., which is strictly decreasing. That is impossible. So, x′1 = ().\nDefinition 13 (Lexicographic ordering on tuples) Let (x1, . . . , xn, . . .) and (y1, . . . , ym, . . .) be 2 finite or infinite tuples ∈ T . (x1, . . . , xn, . . .) <lex∞ (y1, . . . , ym, . . .) iff ∃i ≥ 1 such that:\n∀j < i, xj = yj and yi exists and:\neither the tuple (x1, . . . , xn, . . .) is finite with a number of elements equal to i− 1 (so, xi does not exist), or xi exists and xi < yi.\n(x1, . . . , xn, . . .) =lex∞ (y1, . . . , ym, . . .) iff the tuples contain the same number p ∈ N∪ {∞} of elements and ∀i, 1 ≤ i ≤ p, xi = yi. So, we define: (x1, . . . , xn, . . .) ≤lex∞ (y1, . . . , ym, . . .) iff\n(x1, . . . , xn, . . .) =lex∞ (y1, . . . , ym, . . .) or (x1, . . . , xn, . . .) <lex∞ (y1, . . . , ym, . . .).\nThe ordering <lex∞ is a generalisation of the classical lexicographic ordering (see Xuong, 1992) to the case of infinite tuples. This ordering is complete but not well-founded (there exist infinite sequences which are strictly non-increasing: (0) <lex∞ (0, 0) <lex∞ . . .<lex∞ (0, . . . , 0, . . .) <lex∞ . . .<lex∞ (0, 1)). Since the even values and the odd values in the tupled value of an argument do not play the same role, we cannot use a classical lexicographic comparison. So, we compare tupled values in two steps:\nThe “first step” compares the number of attack branches and the number of defence branches of each argument. So, we have two criteria (one for the defence and the other for the attack). These criteria are aggregated using a cautious method: we conclude if one of the arguments has more defence branches (it is better according to the defence criterion) and less attack branches than the other argument (it is also better according to the attack criterion). Note that we conclude positively only when all the criteria agree: if one of the arguments has more defence branches (it is better according to the defence criterion) and more attack branches than the other argument (it is worse according to the attack criterion), the arguments are considered to be incomparable.\nElse, the arguments have the same number of defence branches and the same number of attack branches, and a “second step” compares the quality of the attacks and the quality of the defences using the length of each branch. This comparison is made with a lexicographic principle (see Definition 13) and gives two criteria which are again aggregated using a cautious method. In case of disagreement, the arguments are considered to be incomparable.\nLet us consider some examples:\n[(2), (1)] is better than [(2), (1, 1)] because there are less attack branches in the first tupled value than in the second tupled value, the numbers of defence branches being the same (first step).\n[(2), (1)] is incomparable with [(2, 2), (1, 1)] because there are less defence branches and less attack branches in the first tupled value than in the second tupled value (first step).\n[(2), (3)] is better than [(2), (1)] because there are weaker attack branches in the first tupled value than in the second tupled value (the attack branch of the first tupled value is longer than the one of the second tupled value), the defence branches being the same (second step, using the lexicographic comparison applied on even parts then on odd parts of the tupled values).\n[(2), (3)] is better than [(4), (3)] because there are stronger defence branches in the first tupled value than in the second tupled value (the defence branch is shorter in the first tupled value than in the second tupled value), the attack branches being the same (second step).\n[(2), (1)] is incomparable with [(4), (3)] because there are worse attack branches and better defence branches in the first tupled value than in the second tupled value (second step).\nThe comparison of arguments is done using Algorithm 1 which implements the principle of a double comparison (first quantitative, then qualitative) with two criteria (one defence criterion and one attack criterion) using a cautious method.\nAlgorithm 1: Comparison of two tupled values\n% Description of the parameters: % % v, w: 2 tupled values % % Notations: % % |vp| (resp. |wp|): number of elements in the even component of v (resp. w) % % if vp (resp. wp) is infinite then |vp| (resp. |wp|) is taken equal to ∞ % % |vi| (resp. |wi|): number of elements in the odd component of v (resp. w) % % if vi (resp. wi) is infinite then |vi| (resp. |wi|) is taken equal to ∞ % % As usual, ≻ will denote the strict relation associated with defined by: % % v ≻ w iff v w and not(w v). %\nbegin 1 if v = w then v w AND w v % Case 1 % 2 else 3 if |vi| = |wi| AND |vp| = |wp| then % lexicographic comparisons between vp and wp and between vi and wi % 4 if vp ≤lex∞ wp AND vi ≥lex∞ wi then v ≻ w % case 2 % 5 else 6 if vp ≥lex∞ wp AND vi ≤lex∞ wi then v ≺ w % case 3 % 7 else v 6 w AND v 6 w % Incomparable tupled values. case 4 % 8 else 9 if |vi| ≥ |wi| AND |vp| ≤ |wp| then v ≺ w % case 5 % 10 else 11 if |vi| ≤ |wi| AND |vp| ≥ |wp| then v ≻ w % case 6 % 12 else v 6 w AND v 6 w % Incomparable tupled values.

The tupled value [(), 1∞] is the only minimal value of the partial preordering .\nNotation: the partial preordering on the set v(A) induces a partial preordering on the arguments (the partial preordering on A will be denoted like the partial preordering on v(A)): A B if and only if v(A) v(B)22. In order to present the underlying principles satisfied by the global valuation, we first consider the different ways for modifying the defence part or the attack part of an argument:\nDefinition 14 (Adding/removing a branch to an argument) Let A be an argument whose tupled value is v(A) = [vp(A), vi(A)] with vp(A) = (x p 1, . . . , x p n) and vi(A) = (x i 1, . . . , x i m) (vp(A) or vi(A) may be empty but not simultaneously). Adding (resp. removing) a defence branch to A is defined by: vp(A) becomes Sort(x p 1, . . . , x p n, x p n+1) where x p n+1 is the length of the added branch (resp. ∃j ∈ [1..n] such that vp(A) becomes (xp1, . . . , x p j−1, x p j+1, . . . , x p n)). And the same thing on vi(A) for adding (resp. removing) an attack branch to A.\nDefinition 15 (Increasing/decreasing the length of a branch of an argument) Let A be an argument whose tupled value is v(A) = [vp(A), vi(A)] with vp(A) = (x p 1, . . . , x p n) and vi(A) = (x i 1, . . . , x i m) (vp(A) or vi(A) may be empty but not simultaneously). Increasing (resp. decreasing) the length of a defence branch of A is defined by: ∃j ∈ [1..n] such that vp(A) becomes (xp1, . . . , x p j−1, x ′p j , x p j+1, . . . , x p n) where x ′p j > x p j (resp. x′pj < x p j) and the parity of x ′p j is the parity of x p j . And the same thing on vi(A) for increasing (resp. decreasing) an attack branch to A.\nDefinition 16 (Improvement/degradation of the defences/attacks) Let A be an argument whose tupled value is v(A) = [vp(A), vi(A)] (vp(A) or vi(A) may be empty but not simultaneously). We define:\nAn improvement (resp. degradation) of the defence consists in\nadding a defence branch to A if initially vp(A) 6= 0∞ (resp. removing a defence branch of A);\nor decreasing (resp. increasing) the length of a defence branch of A;\nor removing the only defence branch leading to A (resp. adding a defence branch leading to A if initially vp(A) = 0 ∞);\nAn improvement (resp. degradation) of the attack consists in\nadding (resp. removing) an attack branch to A;\nor decreasing (resp. increasing) the length of an attack branch of A.\nProperty 10 (Underlying principles) Let v be a valuation with tuples (Definition 10) associated with Algorithm 1, v respects the following principles:\nP1′ The valuation is maximal for an argument without attackers and non maximal for an argument which is attacked (whether it is defended or not).\n22. We will also use the notation B A defined by: B A iff A B.\nP2′ The valuation of an argument takes into account all the branches which are rooted in this argument.\nP3′ The improvement of the defence or the degradation of the attack of an argument leads to an increase of the value of this argument.\nP4′ The improvement of the attack or the degradation of the defence of an argument leads to a decrease of the value of the argument.\nExample 4 (continuation) With the valuation with tuples, we obtain:\nv(E1) = v(D2) = v(D3) = v(C4) = v(B4) = [0 ∞, ()], v(D1) = v(C2) = v(C3) = v(B3) = [(), (1)], v(C1) = v(B2) = [(2), ()], v(B1) = [(2), (3)], v(A) = [(2, 4), (1, 3, 3)].\nSo, we have:\nE1, D2, D3, C4, B4 ≻\nC1, B2 E1, D2, D3, C4, B4 ≻ but also ≻ B1 A ≻\nD1, C2, C3, B3\nA is incomparable with almost all the other arguments (except with the leaves of the graph). Similarly, on the hatched part of the graph, we obtain the following results:\nE1, D2 ≻ C1 ≻ B1 ≻ A ≻ D1, C2 A is now comparable with all the other arguments (in particular, A is “worse” than its defender C1 and than its direct attacker B1)."

Let us recall here an example of the essential point which differentiates them (this example has already been presented at the beginning of Section 3):\nB\nD C1\nC2\nC’ B’\nIn the local approach, B′ is better than B (since B′ suffers one attack whereas B suffers two attacks). In the global approach, B is better than B′ (since it has at least a defence whereas B′ has none). In this case, C1 loses its negative status of attacker, since it is in fact “carrying a defence” for B. The following table synthesises the results about the different proposed valuations:\nglobal approach\narguments having only attack branches\narguments having attack branches and defence branches\narguments having only defence branches\narguments never attacked\nlocal approach\narguments having several unattacked direct attackers\narguments having only one unattacked direct attacker\narguments having only one attacked direct attacker (possibly defended)\narguments having several attacked direct attackers (possibly defended)\narguments never attacked\nThe difference between the local approaches and the global approach is also illustrated by the following property:\nProperty 11 (Independence of branches in the global approach) Let A be an argument having the following direct attackers:\nA1 whose value is v(A1) = [(a 1 p1 , . . . , a1pm1 ), (a1i1 , . . . , a 1 im1 )], . . . , An whose value is v(An) = [(a n p1 , . . . , anpmn ), (a n i1 , . . . , animn )].\nLet A′ be an argument having the following direct attackers:\nA1p1 whose value is v(A 1 p1 ) = [(a1p1)()], . . . , A1pm1 whose value is v(A1pm1 ) = [(a1pm1 )()], A1i1 whose value is v(A 1 i1 ) = [()(a1i1)], . . . , A1im1 whose value is v(A1im1 ) = [()(a1im1 )], . . . , Anp1 whose value is v(A n p1 ) = [(anp1)()], . . . ,\nAnpmn whose value is v(A n pmn ) = [(anpmn )()], Ani1 whose value is v(A n i1 ) = [()(ani1)], . . . , Animn whose value is v(A n imn ) = [()(animn )].\nThen v(A) = v(A′).\nThis property illustrates the “independence” of branches during the computation of the values in the global approach, even when these branches are not graphically independent. On the following example, A and A′ have the same value [(2, 2)()] though they are the root of different subgraphs:\nAB\nC1\nC2\nC1\nC2 B2\nB1\nA’\nThis property is not satisfied by the local approach since, using the underlying principles of the local approach (see Property 4), the value of the argument A must be at least as good as (and sometimes better than23) the value of the argument A′ (A having one direct attacker, and A′ having two direct attackers)."

This acceptability is defined with respect to some properties and the sets which satisfy these properties are called acceptable sets or extensions.

This work has been presented in a workshop (Cayrol & Lagasquie-Schiex, 2003b).\nDefinition 17 (Basic properties of extensions following Dung, 1995) Let <A,R> be an argumentation system, we have:\nConflict-free set A set E ⊆ A is conflict-free if and only if 6 ∃A,B ∈ E such that ARB.\nCollective defence Consider E ⊆ A, A ∈ A. E collectively defends A if and only if ∀B ∈ A, if BRA,∃C ∈ E such that CRB. E defends all its elements if and only if ∀A ∈ E, E collectively defends A.\nDung (1995) defines several semantics for collective acceptability: mainly, the admissible semantics, the preferred semantics and the stable semantics (with corresponding extensions: the admissible sets, the preferred extensions and the stable extensions).\nDefinition 18 (Some semantics and extensions following Dung, 1995) Let <A,R> be an argumentation system.\nAdmissible semantics (admissible set) A set E ⊆ A is admissible if and only if E is conflict-free and E defends all its elements.\nPreferred semantics (preferred extension) A set E ⊆ A is a preferred extension if and only if E is maximal for set inclusion among the admissible sets.\nStable semantics (stable extension) A set E ⊆ A is a stable extension if and only if E is conflict-free and E attacks each argument which does not belong to E (∀A ∈ A\\E, ∃B ∈ E such that BRA).\nNote that in all the above definitions, each attacker of a given argument is considered separately (the “direct attack” as a whole is not considered). Dung (1995) proves that:\nAny admissible set of <A,R> is included in a preferred extension of <A,R>. There always exists at least one preferred extension of <A,R>. If <A,R> is well-founded then there is only one preferred extension which is also the only stable extension.\nAny stable extension is also a preferred extension (the converse is false).\nThere is not always a stable extension.\nProperty 12 The set of leaves (i.e. {A|R−(A) = ∅}) is included in every preferred extension and in every stable extension."

      "heading" : "4.2 Different levels of collective acceptability",
      "text" : "Under a given semantics, and following Dung, the acceptability of an argument depends on its membership to an extension under this semantics. We consider three possible cases25:\n25. The terminology used in this section is also used in the domain of nonmonotonic reasoning (see Pinkas & Loui, 1992): the word uni comes from the word universal which is a “synonym” of the word skeptical, and the word exi comes from the word existential which is a “synonym” of the word credulous. We have chosen to use the words uni and exi because they recall the logical quantificators ∀ (for all) and ∃ (exists at least one).\nthe argument can be uni-accepted, when it belongs to all the extensions of this semantics,\nor the argument can be exi-accepted, when it belongs to at least one extension of this semantics,\nor the argument can be not-accepted when it does not belong to any extension of this semantics.\nHowever, these three levels seem insufficient. For example, what should be concluded in the case of two arguments A and B which are exi-accepted and such that ARB or BRA?\nSo, we introduce a new definition which takes into account the situation of the argument w.r.t. its attackers. This refines the class of the exi-accepted arguments under a given semantics S.\nDefinition 19 (Cleanly-accepted argument) Consider A ∈ A, A is cleanly-accepted if and only if A belongs to at least one extension of S and ∀B ∈ A such that BRA, B does not belong to any extension of S.\nThus, we capture the idea that an argument will be better accepted, if its attackers are not-accepted.\nProperty 13 Consider A ∈ A and a semantics S such that each extension for S is conflictfree. If A is uni-accepted then A is cleanly-accepted. The converse is false.\nThe notion of cleanly-accepted argument refines the class of the exi-accepted arguments. For a semantics S and an argument A, we have the following states:\nA can be uni-accepted, if A belongs to all the extensions for S (so, it will also be cleanly-accepted);\nor A can be cleanly-accepted (so, it is by definition also exi-accepted); note that it is possible that the argument is also uni-accepted;\nor A can be only-exi-accepted, if A is not cleanly-accepted, but A is exi-accepted;\nor A is not-accepted if A does not belong to any extension for S.\nExample 9 Consider the following argumentation system.\nJ\nH\nI E A\nB\nC1D C2\nF\nG\nThere are two preferred extensions {D,C2, A,G} and {D,C2, E,G, I}. So, for the preferred semantics, the acceptability levels are the following:\nD, C2 and G are uni-accepted, I is cleanly-accepted but not uni-accepted,\nA and E are only-exi-accepted,\nB, C1, F , H and J are not-accepted.\nNote that, in all the cases where there is only one extension, the first three levels of acceptability coincide26. This is the case:\n26. If there is only one extension then the fact that A belongs to all the extensions is equivalent to the fact that A belongs to at least one extension. Moreover, with only one extension containing A, all the attackers of A do not belong to an extension. So, A is cleanly-accepted.\nUnder the preferred semantics, when there is no even cycle (see Doutre, 2002).\nUnder the basic semantics (another semantics proposed by Dung – see Dung, 1995; Doutre, 2002 – which is not presented here and which has only one extension).\nLooking more closely, we can prove the following result (proof in Appendix A):\nProperty 14 Under the stable semantics, the class of the uni-accepted arguments coincides with the class of the cleanly-accepted arguments.\nThen, using a result issued from the work of Dunne and Bench-Capon (2001, 2002) and reused by Doutre (2002) which shows that, when there is no odd cycle, all the preferred extensions are stable27, we apply Property 14 and we obtain the following consequence:\nConsequence 1 Under the preferred semantics, when there is no odd cycle, the class of the uni-accepted arguments coincides with the class of the cleanly-accepted arguments.\nFinally, the exploitation of the gradual interaction-based valuations (see Section 3) allows us to define new levels of collective acceptability.\nLet v be a gradual valuation and let be the associated preordering (partial or complete) on A. This preordering can be used inside each acceptability level (for example, the level of the exi-accepted arguments) in order to identify arguments which are better accepted than others.\nExample 9 (continuation) Two different gradual valuations are applied on the same graph:\nJ\nI H\nE A\nB\nC1D C2\nF\nG\n0,674 0,482\n0,5\n1 1\n0,590\n0,694 0,441\n0,666\n0,4\n0.5\nBesnard & Hunter’s (2001) valuation\nWith the instance of the generic valuation proposed by Besnard and Hunter (2001) (see Section 3.1), we obtain the following comparisons:\nD,C2 ≻ I ≻ E ≻ G ≻ J ≻ C1, F ≻ A ≻ H ≻ B\n27.

In Example 9, we obtain:\nWith the valuation of Besnard and Hunter (2001) and under the preferred semantics, E ≻ G despite the fact that G is uni-accepted and E is only-exi-accepted. With the valuation with tuples and under the preferred semantics, H ≻ E despite the fact that E is only-exi-accepted and H is not-accepted.\nThese counter-intuitive situations illustrate the difference between the acceptability definition and the valuation definitions (even if both use the interaction between arguments, they do not use it in the same way)."

      "heading" : "4.3 Towards a gradual individual acceptability",
      "text" : "The individual acceptability is based on the comparison of an argument with its attackers.\nThe first proposal has been to select an argument if and only if it does not have any attacker (see Elvang-Goransson et al., 1993).\nThis has later been extended by Amgoud and Cayrol (1998) where, using a preference relation between arguments (an intrinsic valuation), an argument is accepted if and only if it is preferred to each of its attackers.\nFollowing this proposal, we propose the same mechanism but with the interaction-based valuation.\nGiven v a gradual valuation, the preordering induced by v can be directly used in order to compare, from the acceptability point of view, an argument and its attackers28. This defines a new class of acceptable arguments: well-defended arguments.\nDefinition 20 (Well-defended argument) Consider A ∈ A, A is well-defended (for v) if and only if ∀B ∈ A such that BRA, B 6≻ A.\nThus, we capture the idea that an argument will be better accepted if it is at least as good as its direct attackers (or incomparable with them in the case of a partial ordering). The set of well-defended arguments will depend on the valuation used.\nUsing this new notion, the set of the arguments is partitioned in three classes:\nthe first class contains the arguments which are not attacked,\nthe second class contains the arguments which are attacked but are well-defended,\nthe third class contains the other arguments (attacked and not well-defended).\nNote that the set of the well-defended arguments corresponds to the union of the two first classes. A further refinement uses the gradual valuation inside each of the classes as in Section 4.2.\nIn Example 9 presented in Section 4.2, the well-defended arguments are:\nD, C2, G, H and A (A is incomparable with B but better than E) for the valuation with tuples,\nthough with the valuation of Besnard and Hunter (2001) the well-defended arguments are D, C2, G, I and E (E is better than A).\nNote also that, as in the semantics of Dung (1995), Definition 20 considers the attackers one by one. It is not suitable for a valuation which handles the “direct attack” as a whole (as the valuation of Besnard and Hunter (2001) – see the counterexamples presented in Section 4.4).\n28. This idea is also used in the notion of “defeat” proposed by Bench-Capon (2002). So, there is a link between a “well-defended argument” and an argument which is not “attacked” in the sense of BenchCapon (2002) by its direct attackers. Note that, in the work of Bench-Capon (2002), the valuation is an extra knowledge added in the argumentation framework. In contrast, here, the v-preference is extracted from the attack graph."

This approach is essentially “local” since it computes the value of the argument only from the value of its direct attackers.\nThen, an approach based on a labelling which takes the form of a pair of tuples; this labelling memorises the structure of the graph representing the interactions (the “attack graph”), associating each branch with its length (number of the edges from the leaf to the current node) in the attack graph (if the length of the branch is an even integer, the branch is a defence branch for the current node, otherwise the branch is an attack branch for the current node). This approach is said to be “global” since it computes the value of the argument using the whole attack graph influencing the argument.\nWe have shown that each of these valuations induces a preordering on the set of the arguments, and we have brought to light the main differences between these two approaches.\nRegarding the second issue, two distinct approaches have been proposed:\nFirst, in the context of the collective acceptability of Dung (1995): three levels of acceptability (uni-accepted, exi-accepted, not-accepted) were already defined. More graduality can be introduced in the collective acceptability using the notion of cleanlyaccepted arguments (those whose direct attackers are not-accepted).\nThen, in the context of individual acceptability: using the previously defined gradual valuations, the new notion of well-defended arguments has been introduced (those which are preferred to their direct attackers in the sense of a given gradual valuation v).\nThe first concept induces a refinement of the level of exi-accepted in two sublevels (cleanlyaccepted arguments and only-exi-accepted arguments). The gradual valuation allows graduality inside each level of this collective acceptability.\nThe second concept induces two new levels of acceptability (well-defended arguments and not-well-defended arguments). The gradual valuation also allows graduality inside each level of this individual acceptability.\nRegarding our initial purpose of introducing graduality in the definition of acceptability, we have adopted a basic principle:\nacceptability is strongly related to the interactions between arguments (represented on the graph of interactions),\nand an argument is all the more acceptable if it is preferred to its direct attackers.\nThen, we have followed two different directions. One is based on a refinement of an existing partition and remains in the framework of Dung’s work. The other one is based on the original concept of “being well-defended”, and deserves further investigation, in particular from a computational point of view."

      "text" : "We propose an algorithm for computing the tupled values for an arbitrary graph (cyclic or acyclic, the cycles may be isolated or not). This algorithm uses a principle of propagation of values: an argument is evaluated when the values of its direct attackers are known. We must consider the cycles as meta-arguments which are evaluated when all the “direct attackers of the cycle” (i.e. the direct attackers of one of the elements of the cycle which do not belong to the cycle) are evaluated. The beginning of the process is as follows: we consider that all the arguments have the initial value [0∞, ()], and only the leaves of the graph are “marked” as having their final values. Thus, we have the following partition of the graph G:\nGv: the part of the graph already evaluated (at the beginning, this part contains only the leaves of the graph), G¬v: the part of the graph which is not evaluated (at the beginning, this part contains all the arguments of the graph G except the leaves).\nThe algorithm also relies on a special data structure denoted by L giving the list of the cycles in the graph and their main characteristics:\nlist of the arguments which belong to this cycle,\nlist of the arguments which belong to this cycle and which have direct attackers outside the cycle (these arguments are called inputs of the cycle; those which will be used in order to propagate the values across the cycle in the case of a non isolated cycle); this list will be empty in the case of an isolated cycle.\nRemark: For the sake of efficiency, the interconnected cycles (see Definition 1) will be considered as a “whole” by the algorithm and will be used like a “meta-cycle”. For example, the two cycles A − B − A and B − C − B which do not have any direct attacker outside of the cycles, will be described in the data structure L as only one “meta-cycle” with the following lists:\nA, B, C,\nnothing (because it is an isolated “meta-cycle”).\nIn order to avoid some ambiguity, these “meta-cycles” are defined as mcycles:\nDefinition 21 (mcycle) Let G be an attack graph. Let CC be the set of all the cycles of G. Let CC′ ⊆ CC and CC′ = {C1, . . . , Cn} be a set of cycles. Let ACC′ be the set: {Aj such that ∃Ci ∈ CC′ and Aj ∈ Ci}. If CC′ satisfies the following properties:\n∀Aj , Ak ∈ ACC′ , ∃ a path from Aj to Ak such that each element (arguments or edges between arguments) of the path belongs to cycles of CC′, and ∀Ck ∈ CC \\ CC′, 6 ∃Ci ∈ CC′ such that Ck is interconnected with Ci.\nThen the union of the Ci belonging to CC′ is a mcycle.\nThus, we make a partition of CC using the notion of interconnection between cycles, each element of the partition being a different mcycle.

Intuitively, an argument labelled with ? is both supported and weakened. Definition 4 (Jakobovits and Vermeir’s labellings, 1999) Let <A,R> be an argumentation system. A complete labelling of <A,R> is a function Lab : A → {+, ?,−} such that: 1. If Lab(A) ∈ {?,−} then ∃B ∈ R−(A) such that Lab(B) ∈ {+, ?} 2. If Lab(A) ∈ {+, ?} then ∀B ∈ R−(A) ∪R+(A), Lab(B) ∈ {?,−} The underlying intuition is that an argument can only be weakened (label − or ?) if one of its direct attackers is supported (condition 1); an argument can get a support only if all its direct attackers are weakened and an argument which is supported (label + or ?) weakens the arguments it attacks (condition 2). So: If A has no attacker Lab(A) = +. If Lab(A) =? then ∃B ∈ R−(A) such that Lab(B) =?. If (∀B ∈ R−(A), Lab(B) = −) then Lab(A) = +. If Lab(A) = + then ∀B ∈ R−(A) ∪R+(A), Lab(B) = −. Every argumentation system can be completely labelled. The associated semantics is that S is an acceptable set of arguments iff there exists a complete labelling Lab of <A,R> such that S = {A|Lab(A) = +}.

An argument is structured as a pair 〈support, conclusion〉, where support is a consistent set of formulae that enables to prove the formula conclusion. The attack relation considered here is strict and cycles are not allowed. The notion of a “tree of arguments” allows a concise and exhaustive representation of attackers and defenders of a given argument, root of the tree. A function, called a “categoriser”, assigns a value to a tree of arguments. This value represents the relative strength of an argument (root of the tree) given all its attackers and defenders. Another function, called an “accumulator”, synthesises the values assigned to all the argument trees whose root is an argument for (resp. against) a given conclusion. The phase of categorisation therefore corresponds to an interaction-based valuation. Besnard and Hunter (2001) introduce the following function Cat: if R−(A) = ∅, then Cat(A) = 1 if R−(A) 6= ∅ with R−(A) = {A1, .",

Starting from the framework proposed by Dung in 1995, our purpose is to introduce “graduality” in the selection of the best arguments, i.e. to be able to partition the set of the arguments in more than the two usual subsets of “selected” and “non-selected” arguments in order to represent different levels of selection. Our basic idea is that an argument is all the more acceptable if it can be preferred to its attackers. First, we discuss general principles underlying a “gradual” valuation of arguments based on their interactions. Following these principles, we define several valuation models for an abstract argumentation system. Then, we introduce “graduality” in the concept of acceptability of arguments. We propose new acceptability classes and a refinement of existing classes taking advantage of an available “gradual” valuation.",
