It works not only for preferences that are pairwise comparisons of criteria as AHP does, but for preferences of any n-wise (with n≥2) comparisons of criteria that can be expressed as linear homogeneous equations. The general idea of α-D MCDM is to assign null-null positive parameters α1, α2, …, αp to the coefficients in the right-hand side of each preference that diminish or increase them in order to transform the above linear homogeneous system of equations which has only the null-solution, into a system having After finding the general solution of this system, the principles used to assign particular values to all parameters α’s is the second important part of α-D, yet to be deeper investigated in the future. In the current paper we herein propose the Fairness Principle, i.e. each coefficient should be discounted with the same percentage (we think this is fair: not making any favouritism or unfairness to any coefficient), but the reader can propose other principles. For consistent decision-making problems with pairwise comparisons, α-Discounting Method together with the Fairness Principle give the same result as AHP.\n2   \nBut for weak inconsistent decision-making problem, α -Discounting together with the Fairness Principle give a different result from AHP. α-Discounting/Fairness-Principle together give a justifiable result for strong inconsistent decision-making problems with two preferences and two criteria; but for more than two preferences with more than two criteria and the Fairness Principle has to be replaced by another principle of assigning numerical values to all parameters α’s. Since Saaty’s AHP is not the topic of this paper, we only recall the main steps of applying this method, so the results of α-D MCDM and of AHP could be compared. AHP works for only for pairwise comparisons of criteria, from which a square Preference Matrix, A (of size n×n), is built. Then one computes the maximum eigenvalue λ max of A and its corresponding eigenvector. If λ max is equal to the size of the square matrix, then the decision-making problem is consistent, and its corresponding normalized eigenvector (Perron-Frobenius vector) is the priority vector. If If λ max is strictly greater than the size of the square matrix, then the decision-making problem is inconsistent. One raise to the second power matrix A, and again the resulted matrix is raised to the second power, etc. obtaining the sequence of matrices A2, A4, A8, …, etc. In each case, one computes the maximum eigenvalue and its associated normalized eigenvector, until the difference between two successive normalized eigenvectors is smaller than a given threshold. The last such normalized eigenvector will be the priority vector. Saaty defined the Consistency Index as:\nCI(A) = max( ) 1 A n n λ − − , \nwhere n is the size of the square matrix A.\n2. α-Discounting Method for Multi-Criteria Decision Making (α-D MCDM).\n2.1. Description of α-D MCDM.\nThe general idea of this paper is to discount the coefficients of an inconsistent problem to some percentages in order to transform it into a consistent problem.\nLet the Set of Criteria be C = {C1, C2, …, Cn}, with n ≥ 2, and the Set of Preferences be P = {P1, P2, …, Pm}, with m ≥ 1. Each preference Pi is a linear homogeneous equation of the above criteria C1, C2, …, Cn:\nPi = f(C1, C2, …, Cn). We need to construct a basic belief assignment (bba):\nm: C [0, 1]\nsuch that m(Ci) = xi , with 0 ≤ xi ≤ 1, and\n1 ( ) 1\nn\ni i m x = =∑ . \n3   \nWe need to find all variables xi in accordance with the set of preferences P. Thus, we get an m˟n linear homogeneous system of equations whose associated matrix is A = (aij), 1 ≤ i ≤ m and 1 ≤ j ≤ n. In order for this system to have non-null solutions, the rank of the matrix A should be strictly less than n.\n2.2. Classification of Linear Decision-Making Problems. a) We say that a linear decision-making problem is consistent if, by any substitution of a\nvariable xi from an equation into another equation, we get a result in agreement with all equations.\nb) We say that a linear decision-making problem is weakly inconsistent if, by at least one substitution of a variable xi from an equation into another equation, we get a result in disagreement with at least another equation in the following ways:\n(WD1) 1\n2 2 2 1 , 1; , 1, i j i j x k x k x k x k k k ⋅ ⋅ = >⎧ ⎫ ⎨ ⎬= > ≠⎩ ⎭  \n  or   \n(WD2) 1\n2 2 2 1 ,0 1; ,0 1, i j i j x k x k x k x k k k ⋅ ⋅ = < <⎧ ⎫ ⎨ ⎬= < < ≠⎩ ⎭  \nor (WD3) { }, 1i ix k x k⋅= ≠   (WD1)-(WD3) are weak disagreements, in the sense that for example a variable x > y always, but with different ratios (for example: x=3y and x=5y). All disagreements in this case should be like (WD1)-(WD3).\nc) We say that a linear decision-making problem is strongly inconsistent if, by at least one substitution of a variable xi from an equation into another equation, we get a result in disagreement with at least another equation in the following way:\n(SD4) 1\n2 ; , i j i j x k x x k x ⋅ ⋅ =⎧ ⎫ ⎨ ⎬=⎩ ⎭ with 0 < k1 < 1 < k2 or 0 < k2 < 1 < k1 (i.e. from one equation one\ngets xi < xj while from the other equation one gets the opposite inequality: xj < xi).\nAt least one inconsistency like (SD4) should exist, no matter if other types of inconsistencies like (WD1)-(WD3) may occur or not.\nCompute the determinant of A. a) If det(A)=0, the decision problem is consistent, since the system of equations is\ndependent.\n4   \nIt is not necessarily to parameterize the system. {In the case we have parameterized, we can use the Fairness Principle – i.e. setting all parameters equal α 1 = α 2 = … = α p = α >  0}. Solve this system; find its general solution. Replace the parameters and secondary variables, getting a particular solution. Normalize this particular solution (dividing each component by the sum of all components). Wet get the priority vector (whose sum of its components should be 1). b) If det(A)≠ 0, the decision problem is inconsistent, since the homogeneous linear system has only the null-solution.\nb1) If the inconsistency is weak, then parameterize the right-hand side coefficients, and the denote the system matrix A(α).\nCompute det(A(α)) = 0 in order to get the parametric equation. If the Fairness Principle is used, set all parameters equal, and solve for α >  0.  Replace α in A(α ) and solve the resulting dependent homogeneous linear system. Similarly as in a), replace each secondary variable by 1, and normalize the particular solution in order to get the priority vector.\nb2) If the inconsistency is strong, the Fairness Principle may not work properly. Another approachable principle might by designed.\nOr, get more information and revise the strong inconsistencies of the decision-making problem.\n2.3. Comparison between AHP and α-D MCDM: a) α-D MCDM’s general solution includes all particular solutions, that of AHP as well; b) α-D MCDM uses all kind of comparisons between criteria, not only paiwise comparisons; c) for consistent problems, AHP and α-D MCDM/Fairness-Principle give the same result; d) for large inputs, in α-D MCDM we can put the equations under the form of a matrix (depending on some parameters alphas), and then compute the determinant of the matrix which should be zero; after that, solve the system (all can be done on computer using math software); the software such as MATHEMATICA and APPLE for example can do these determinants and calculate the solutions of this linear system; e) α-D MCDM can work for larger classes of preferences, i.e. preferences that can be transformed in homogeneous linear equations, or in non-linear equations and/or inequalities – see more below.\n2.4. Generalization of α -D MCDM. Let each preference be expressed as a linear or non-linear equation or inequality. All preferences together will form a system of linear/non-linear equations/inequalities, or a mixed system of equations and inequalities. Solve this system, looking for a strictly positive solution (i.e. all unknowns xi > 0). Then normalize the solution vector. If there are more such numerical solutions, do a discussion: analyze the normalized solution vector in each case. If there is a general solution, extract the best particular solution.\n5   \nIf there is no strictly positive solution, parameterize the coefficients of the system, find the parametric equation, and look for some principle o apply in order to find the numerical values of the parametersα ‘s. A discussion might also be involved. We may get undetermined solutions. 3. Degrees of Consistency and Inconsistency inα -D MCDM/Fairness-Principle. For α -D MCDM/Fairness-Principle we have the followings:\na) If 0 < α < 1, then α is the degree of consistency of the decision-making problem, and β = 1-α is the degree of inconsistency of the decision-making problem. b) If α > 1, then 1/α is the degree of consistency of the decision-making problem, and β = 1-1/α is the degree of inconsistency of the decision-making problem.\n4. Principles of α-D MCDM (Second Part).\na) In applications, for the second part of α -D Method, the Fairness Principle can be replaced by other principles. Expert’s Opinion. For example, if we have information that a preference’s coefficient should be discounted twice more than another coefficient (due to an expert’s opinion), and another preference’s coefficient should be discounted a third of another one, then appropriately we set for example: α 1= 2α 2 and respectively α 3 = (1/3)α 4, etc. in the parametric equation. b) For α -D/Fairness-Principle or Expert’s Opinion. Another idea herein is to set a threshold of consistency tc (or implicitly a threshold of inconsistency ti). Then, if the degree of consistency is smaller than a required tc, the Fairness Principle or Expert’s Opinion (whichever was used) should be discharged, and another principle of finding all parameters α ’s should be designed; and similarly if the degree of inconsistency is bigger than ti.\n5. Extension of α-D MCDM (Non-Linear α-D MCDM). It is not difficult to generalize the α-D MCDM for the case when the preferences are non-linear homogeneous (or even non-homogeneous) equations. This non-linear system of preferences has to be dependent (meaning that its general solution – its main variables - should depend upon at least one secondary variable). If the system is not dependent, we can parameterize it in the same way. Then, again, in the second part of this Non-Linear α-D MCDM we assign some values to each of the secondary variables (depending on extra-information we might receive ), and we also need to design a principle which will help us to find the numerical values for all parameters. We get a particular solution (such extracted from the general solution), which normalized will produce our priority vector. Yet, the Non-Linear α-D MCDM is more complicated, and depends on each non-linear decisionmaking problem. Let’s see some examples. 6. Consistent Example 1.\n6.4. Let the Set of Preferences be:{ }1, 2, 3C C C , and The Set of Criteria be:\n6   \n1. 1C is 4 times as important as 2C . 2. 2C is 3 times as important as 3.C 3. 3C is one twelfth as important as 1C .\nLet ( 1)m C x= , ( 2)m C y= , ( 3)m C z= .\nThe linear homogeneous system associated to this decision-making problem is:\n4 3\n12\nx y y z\nxz\n⎧ ⎪ = ⎪ =⎨ ⎪ ⎪ = ⎩\nwhose associated matrix A1 is:\n1 4 0 0 1 3\n1/12 0 1 −⎛ ⎞ ⎜ ⎟−⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎟−⎝ ⎠ , whence det(A1) = 0, so the DM problem is consistent.\nSolving this homogeneous linear system we get its general solution that we set as a vector [12z 3z z], where z can be any real number (z is considered a secondary variable, while x=12z and y=3z are main variables).\nReplacing z=1, the vector becomes [12 3 1], and then normalizing (dividing by 12+3+1=16 each vector component) we get the priority vector: [12/16 3/16 1/16], so the preference will be on C1.\n6.5. Using AHP, we get the same result. The preference matrix is:\n1 4 12 1/ 4 1 3 1/12 1/ 3 1 ⎛ ⎞ ⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎟ ⎝ ⎠\nwhose maximum eigenvalue is λ max = 3 and its corresponding normalized eigenvector (PerronFrobenius vector) is [12/16 3/16 1/16]. 7. Weak Inconsistent Examples where AHP Doesn’t Work.\nThe Set of Preferences is:{ }1, 2, 3C C C .\n7.4. Weak Inconsistent Example 2. 7.4.1. Α-D MCDM method.\nThe Set of Criteria is: 1. 1C is 2 times as important as 2C and 3 times as important as 3C put together.\n7   \n2. 2C is half as important as 1C . 3. 3C is one third as important as 1C .\nLet ( 1)m C x= , ( 2)m C y= , ( 3)m C z= ;\n2 3\n2\n3\nx y z xy\nxz ⎧ ⎪ = + ⎪ ⎪ =⎨ ⎪ ⎪ =⎪⎩\nAHP cannot be applied on this example because of the form of the first preference, which is not a pairwise comparison. If we solve this homogeneous linear system of equations as it is we get x=y=z=0, since its associated matrix is:\n1 2 3 1/ 2 1 0 1 0 1/ 3 0 1 − −⎛ ⎞ ⎜ ⎟− = − ≠⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎟−⎝ ⎠\nbut the null solution is not acceptable since the sum x+y+z has to be 1. Let’s parameterise each right-hand side coefficient and get the general solution of the above system:\n1 2\n3\n4\n2 3 (1)\n(2) 2\n3\nx y z\ny x\nz x\nα α α\nα\n= +\n=\n= (3) ⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪⎩\nwhere 1 2 3 4, , , 0α α α α > .

Let’s verify it:\n0.35354x y ≅ instead of 0.50, i.e. 2 70.71% 2 = of the original.\n0.23570z x ≅ instead of 0.33333, i.e. 70.71% of the original.\n1.41421 2.12132x y z≅ + instead of 2 3y z+ , i.e. 70.71% of 2 respectively 70.71% of 3.\nSo, it was a fair discount for each coefficient.\n7.1.2. Matrix Method of using α -Discounting. The determinant of the homogeneous linear system (1), (2), (3) is:\n( ) ( ) 1 2\n3 2 4 1 3\n4 1 2 3 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 2 1 0 1 3 α α α α α α α α − − − = + + − + = −\nor 1 3 2 4 1α α α α+ = (parametric equation).\nThe determinant has to be zero in order for the system to have non-null solutions. The rank of the matrix is 2.\n9   \nSo, we find two variables, for example it is easier to solve for y and z from the last two equations, in terms of x :\n3\n4 1 2 1 3 y x z x α α ⎧ =⎪⎪ ⎨ ⎪ = ⎪⎩\nand the procedure follows the same steps as in the previous one. Let’s change Example 1 in order to study various situations.\n7.2. Weak Inconsistent Example 3, which is more weakly inconsistent than Example 2. 1.

Our system becomes now:\n5 153 (10) 12 12 5 204 (11)\n12 12 5 25\n12 y x x z y z = ⋅ = = ⋅ = = ⋅ = 5 (12) 12 ⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪⎩\n15   \nWe see that (10) and (11) together give\n15 20 12 12 y x x z ⋅ = ⋅ or 25 12 y z = ,\nso, they are now consistent with (12).\nFrom (11) we get 20 12 x z= and from (12) we get 25 12 y z= . The priority vector is:\n20 25 1 12 12 z z z⎡ ⎤⎢ ⎥⎣ ⎦\nwhich is normalized to:\n20 20 2012 12 20 25 20 25 12 571 12 12 12 12 12 = = + + + + ,\n25 2512 57 57 12 = , 1 1257 57 12 = , i.e.\n1 2 3\n20 25 12 57 57 57\nC C C T⎡ ⎤ ⎢ ⎥⎣ ⎦\n(13)\n[ ] 1 2 3\nthe highest priority\n0.3509 0.4386 0.2105 C C C T≅\n↑\nLet’s study the result:\n1 2 3\n20 25 12 57 57 57\nC C C T\nx y z\n⎡ ⎤ ⎢ ⎥⎣ ⎦\nRatios: Percentage of Discounting:\n25 2557 1.2520 20 57 y x = = = instead of 3; 1 25 520 41.6% 3 12 α= = =\n20 20 557 1.612 12 3 57 x z = = = = instead of 4; 1 20 512 41.6% 4 12 α= = =\n16   \n25 2557 2.08312 12 57 y z = = = instead of 5; 1 25 512 41.6% 5 12 α= = =\nHence all original proportions, which were respectively equal to 3, 4, and 5 in the\nproblem, were reduced by multiplication with the same factor 1 5\n12 α = , i.e. by getting 41.6% of\neach of them. So, it was fair to reduce each factor to the same percentage 41.6% of itself. But this is not the case in Saaty’s method: its normalized priority vector is\n[ ] 1 2 3 0.2797 0.6267 0.0936\nC C C T x y z ,\nwhere: Ratios: Percentage of Discounting:\n0.6267 2.2406 02797 y x = ≅ instead of 3; 2.2406 74.6867% 3 ≅\n0.2797 2.9882 0.0936 x z = ≅ instead of 4; 2.9882 74.7050% 4 ≅\n06267 6.6955 0.0936 y z = ≅ instead of 5; 6.6955 133.9100% 5 ≅\nWhy, for example, the first proportion, which was equal to 3, was discounted to\n74.6867% of it, while the second proportion, which was equal to 4, was discounted to another percentage (although close) 74.7050% of it? Even more dough we have for the third proportion’s coefficient, which was equal to 5, but was increased to 133.9100% of it, while the previous two proportions were decreased; what is the justification for these? That’s why we think our α-D/Fairness-Principle is better justified. We can solve this same problem using matrices. (5), (6), (7) can be written in another way to form a linear parameterized homogeneous linear system:\n1\n2\n3\n3 = 0 - 4 0 5 0 x y x z y z α α α −⎧ ⎪ =⎨ ⎪ − =⎩\n(14)\nWhose associated matrix is: 1\n1 2\n3\n3 1 0 1 0 - 4 0 1 5 P α α α −⎡ ⎤ ⎢ ⎥= ⎢ ⎥ ⎢ ⎥−⎣ ⎦\n(15)\na) If 1det( ) 0P ≠ then the system (10) has only the null solution 0x y z= = = .\n17   \nb) Therefore, we need to have 1det( ) 0P = , or ( )( )1 2 33 4 5 0α α α− = , or 1 2 32.4 0α α α− = , so we get the same parametric equation as (8).\nIn this case the homogeneous parameterized linear system (14) has a triple infinity of solutions.\nThis method is an extension of Saaty’s method, since we have the possibility to manipulate\nthe parameters 1 2,α α , and 3α . For example, if a second source tells us that x z has to be discounted 2 times as much as y x , and y z should be discounted 3 times less than y x , then we set 2 12α α= , and respectively 13 3 αα = , and the original (5), (6), (7) system becomes:\n( )\n1\n2 1 1\n1 3 1\n3\n4 =4 2 =8\n55 =5 = 3 3 y x x z y z α α α α αα α ⎧ =⎪ ⎪ ⎪ =⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎛ ⎞= ⎜ ⎟⎪\n⎝ ⎠⎩\n(16)\nand we solve it in the same way. 8.2. Weak Inconsistent Example 10. Let’s complicate Jean Dezert’s Weak Inconsistent Example 6.1. with one more preference: 2C is 1.5 times as much as 1C and 3C together. The new system is:\n3\n4\n5\n1.5( ) , , [0,1]\n1 y x x z y z y x z x y z x y x ⎧ =⎪ ⎪ ⎪ =⎪ ⎪ ⎨ = ⎪ ⎪ = +⎪ ⎪ ∈ ⎪ + + =⎩\n(17)\nWe parameterized it:\n18   \n1\n2\n3\n4\n1 2 3 4\n3\n4\n5\n1.5 ( ) , , [0,1]\n1 , , , 0\ny x x z y z y x z x y z x y x α α α α\nα α α α\n⎧ =⎪ ⎪ ⎪ =⎪ ⎪ ⎨ = ⎪ ⎪ = +⎪ ⎪ ∈ ⎪ + + =⎩\n>\n(18)\nIts associated matrix is: 1\n2 2\n3\n4 4\n3 1 0 1 0 -4 0 1 - 5 1.5 -1 1.5 P α α α α α −⎡ ⎤ ⎢ ⎥ ⎢ ⎥= ⎢ ⎥ ⎢ ⎥ ⎣ ⎦\n(19)\nThe rank of matrix 2P should be strictly less than 3 in order for the system (18) to have non-null solution. If we take the first three rows in (19) we get the matrix 1P , whose determinant should be zero, therefore one also gets the previous parametric equation 1 2 32.4α α α= . If we take rows 1, 3, and 4, since they all involve the relations between 2C and the other criteria 1C and 3C we get\n1\n3 3\n4 4\n3 1 0 0 1 - 5 1.5 -1 1.5 P α α α α −⎡ ⎤ ⎢ ⎥= ⎢ ⎥ ⎢ ⎥⎣ ⎦\n(20)\nwhose determinant should also be zero: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )3 1 4 3 4 1 3det 3 1.5 5 1.5 0 0 3 5 0P α α α α α α⎡ ⎤ ⎡ ⎤= + + − + + =⎣ ⎦ ⎣ ⎦\n1 4 3 4 1 34.5 7.5 15 0α α α α α α= + − = (21) If we take\n2\n4 3\n4 4\n1 0 - 4 0 1 - 5 1.5 -1 1.5 P α α α α ⎡ ⎤ ⎢ ⎥= ⎢ ⎥ ⎢ ⎥⎣ ⎦\n(22)\nthen ( ) [ ] [ ]4 4 2 4 3 4 2 4 3det 1.5 0 0 6 5 0 1.5 6 5 0P α α α α α α α α= + + − − + + = + − = (23)\nIf we take\n1\n5 2\n4 4\n3 1 0 1 0 - 4 1.5 -1 1.5 P α α α α −⎡ ⎤ ⎢ ⎥= ⎢ ⎥ ⎢ ⎥⎣ ⎦\n(24)\n19   \nthen ( ) [ ] [ ]5 2 4 1 2 4 2 4 1 2 4det 0 0 6 0 12 1.5 6 12 1.5 0P α α α α α α α α α α= + + − + − = − + = (25) So, these four parametric equations form a parametric system:\n1 2 3\n1 4 3 4 1 3\n4 2 4 3\n2 4 1 2 4\n2.4 0 4.5 7.5 15 0 1.5 6 5 0 6 12 1.5 0 α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α − =⎧ ⎪ + − =⎪ ⎨ + − =⎪ ⎪ − + =⎩\n(26)\nwhich should have a non-null solution.\nIf we consider 1 2 3 5 0\n12 α α α= = = > as we got at the beginning, then substituting all α’s\ninto the last three equations of the system (26) we get:\n4 4 4 5 5 5 5 254.5 7.5 15 0 0.52083 12 12 12 12 48 α α α⎛ ⎞ ⎛ ⎞ ⎛ ⎞⎛ ⎞+ − = ⇒ = =⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎟⎜ ⎟ ⎝ ⎠ ⎝ ⎠ ⎝ ⎠⎝ ⎠\n4 4 4 5 51.5 6 5 0 0.52083 12 12 α α α⎛ ⎞ ⎛ ⎞+ − = ⇒ =⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎟ ⎝ ⎠ ⎝ ⎠\n4 4 4 5 5 56 12 1.5 0 0.52083 12 12 12 α α α⎛ ⎞ ⎛ ⎞⎛ ⎞− + = ⇒ =⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎟⎜ ⎟ ⎝ ⎠ ⎝ ⎠⎝ ⎠\n4α could not be equal to 1 2 3α α α= = since it is an extra preference, because the number of rows was bigger than the number of columns. So the system is consistent, having the same solution as previously, without having added the fourth preference ( )1.5y x z= + .\n9.1. Jean Dezert’s Strong Inconsistent Example 11.  The preference matrix is:\n1\n11 9 9\n1 1 9 9\n19 1 9\nM ⎛ ⎞ ⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎟= ⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎟⎜ ⎟ ⎝ ⎠\nso,\n9 , 1 , 9 9 , x y x y x z x z y z y z = >⎧ ⎪⎪ = <⎨ ⎪\n= >⎪⎩\nThe other three equations: 1 1, 9 , 9 9 y x z x z y= = = result directly from the previous three ones, so we can eliminate them.\n20   \nFrom x>y and y>z (first and third above inequalities) we get x>z, but the second inequality tells us the opposite: x<z; that’s why we have a strong contradiction/inconsistency. Or, if we combine all three we have x>y>z>x… strong contradiction again. Parameterize:\n1\n2\n3\n9 (27) 1 (28) 9 9 x y x z y z α α α = = = (29) ⎧ ⎪⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪⎩\nwhere 1 2 3, , 0α α α > .\nFrom (27) we get: 1 1 9 y x α = , from (28) we get 2 1 9 z x α = , which is replaced in (29) and we get:\n3 3\n2 2\n8199 =y x xαα α α ⎛ ⎞ = ⎜ ⎟ ⎝ ⎠ .\nSo 3 1 2 811 9 x xα α α = or 2 1 3729α α α= (parametric equation).\nThe general solution of the system is:\n1 2\n1 9, , 9 x x x α α ⎛ ⎞ ⎜ ⎟ ⎝ ⎠\nThe general priority vector is:\n1 2\n1 91 9α α ⎡ ⎤ ⎢ ⎥ ⎣ ⎦ .\nConsider the fairness principle, then 1 2 3 1α α α α= = = > are replaced into the parametric equation: 2729α α= , whence 0α = (not good) and 3 1 1\n729 9 α = = .\nThe particular priority vector becomes [ ]2 41 9 9 1 81 6561⎡ ⎤ =⎣ ⎦ and normalized 1 81 6561\n6643 6643 6643 ⎡ ⎤ ⎢ ⎥⎣ ⎦\nBecause the consistency is 1 0.00137 729 α = = is extremely low, we can disregard this solution (and the inconsistency is very big 1 0.99863).β α= − = 9.1.2. Remarks:\na) If in 1M we replace all six 9’s by a bigger number, the inconsistency of the system will increase. Let’s use 11.\nThen 3 1 0.00075\n11 α = = (consistency), while inconsistency 0.99925β = .\nb) But if in 1M we replace all 9’s by the smaller positive number greater than 1, the\nconsistency decreases. Let’s use 2. Then 3 0.1252 iα = = and 0.875β = ;\n21   \nc) Consistency is 1 when replacing all six 9’s by 1. d) Then, replacing all six 9’s by a positive sub unitary number, consistency\ndecreases again. For example, replacing by 0.8 we get 3 1 1.953125 1\n0.8 α = = > ,\nwhence 1 0.512 α = (consistency) and 0.488β = (inconsistency).\n9.2. Jean Dezert’s Strong Inconsistent Example 12.

Generalization of Jean Dezert’s Strong Inconsistent Examples. General Example 13. Let the preference matrix be:\n11\n1 1 t\n1t 1\nt\nt t\nM t\nt ⎛ ⎞ ⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎟= ⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎟⎜ ⎟ ⎝ ⎠ ,\nwith 0t > , and ( )tc M the consistency of tM , ( )ti M inconsistency of tM . We have for the Fairness Principle:\n1 lim ( ) 1tt c M→ = and 1lim ( ) 0tt i M→ = ; lim ( ) 0tt c M→+∞ = and lim ( ) 1tt i M→+∞ = ;\n0 lim ( ) 0tt c M→ = and 0lim ( ) 1tt i M→ = .\nAlso 3 1 t α = , the priority vector is 2 41 t t⎡ ⎤⎣ ⎦ which is normalized as\n22   \n2 4\n2 4 2 4 2 4 1 1 1 1 t t t t t t t t ⎡ ⎤ ⎢ ⎥+ + + + + +⎣ ⎦ .\nIn such situations, when we get strong contradiction of the form x>y>z>x or similarly x<z<x, etc. and the consistency is tiny, we can consider that x=y=z=1/3 (so no criterion is preferable to the other – as in Saaty’s AHP), or just x+y+z=1 (which means that one has the total ignorance too: C1∪C2∪C3).\n10. Strong Inconsistent Example 14. Let C = {C1, C2}, and P = {C1 is important twice as much as C2; C2 is important 5 times as much as C1}. Let m(C1)=x, m(C2)=y. Then: x=2y and y=5x (it is a strong inconsistency since from the first equation we have x>y, while from the second y>x). Parameterize: x=2α1y, y=5α2x, whence we get 2α1=1/(5α2), or 10α1α2=1.\nIf we consider the Fairness Principle, then α1= α2= α>0, and one gets α = 10\n10 ≈ 31.62%\nconsistency, hence y>x. An explanation can be done as in paraconsistent logic (or as in neutrosophic logic): it is possible to have two contradictory statements true simultaneously since a criterion C1 can be more important from a point of view than C2, while from another point of view C2 can be more important than C1. In our decisionmaking problem, not having any more information and having rapidly being required to take a decision, we can prefer C2, since C2 is 5 times more important that C1, while C1 is only 2 times more important than C2, and 5>2. If it’s no hurry, more prudent would be in such dilemma to search for more information on C1 and C2.\n11. Non-Linear/Linear Equation Mixed System Example 15. Let C = {C1, C2, C3}, m(C1)=x, m(C2)=y, m(C3)=z. Let F be: 1. C1 is twice as much important as the product of C2 and C3. 2. C2 is five times as much important as C3.\nWe get the system: x=2yz (non-linear equation) and y=5z (linear equation). The general solution vector of this mixed system is: [10z2 5z z], where z>0. A discussion is necessary now. a) You see for sure that y>z, since 5z>z for z strictly positive. But we don’t see\nanything what the position of x would be?\nb) Let’s simplify the general solution vector by dividing each vector component by z>0, thus we get: [10z 5 1].\n23   \n    If z∈(0, 0.1), then y>z>x. If z=0.1, then y>z=x;\nIf z∈(0.1, 0.5), then y>x>z. If z=0.5, then y=x>z. If z>0.5, then x>y>z.\n12. Non-Linear/Linear Equation/Inequality Mixed System Example 16.\nSince in the previous Example 15 has many variants, assume that a new preference comes in (in addition to the previous two preferences): 3. C1 is less important than C3.\nThe mixed system becomes now: x=2yz (non-linear equation), y=5z (linear equation), and x<z (linear inequality). The general solution vector of this mixed system is: [10z2 5z z], where z>0 and 10z2 < z. From the last two inequalities we get z∈(0, 0.1). Whence the priorities are: y>z>x.\n13. Future Research: To investigate the connection between α-D MCDM and other methods, such as: BordaKendall (BK) method for aggregating ordinal preferences, the simple additive weighting (SAW) method, the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method, and the cross-efficiency evaluation method in data envelopment analysis (DEA).\n14. Conclusion.\nWe have introduced a new method in the multi-criteria decision making, α - Discounting MCDM. In the first part of this method, each preference is transformed into a linear or non-linear equation or inequality, and all together form a system that is resolved – one finds its general solution, from which one extracts the positive solutions. If the system has only the null solution, or it is inconsistent, then one parameterizes the coefficients of the system.\nIn the second part of the method, one chooses a principle for finding the numerical values of the parameters {we have proposed herein the Fairness Principle, or Expert’s Opinion on Discounting, or setting a Consistency (or Inconsistency) Threshold}.\nReferences [1] J.

    "abstractText" : "In this paper we introduce a new procedure called α -Discounting Method for MultiCriteria Decision Making (α-D MCDM), which is as an alternative and extension of Saaty’s Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). It works for any set of preferences that can be transformed into a system of homogeneous linear equations. A degree of consistency (and implicitly a degree of inconsistency) of a decision-making problem are defined. α-D MCDM is generalized to a set of preferences that can be transformed into a system of linear and/or non-linear homogeneous and/or non-homogeneous equations and/or inequalities. Many consistent, weak inconsistent, and strong inconsistent examples are given.",
