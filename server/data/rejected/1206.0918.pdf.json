      "text" : "networks in order to cope with a vagueness and limitations of existing models for decision under imprecise and uncertain knowledge. This paper proposes a framework that combines two disciplines to exploit their own advantages in uncertain and imprecise knowledge representation problems. The framework proposed is a possibilistic logic based one in which Bayesian nodes and their properties are represented by local necessity-valued knowledge base. Data in properties are interpreted as set of valuated formulas. In our contribution possibilistic Bayesian networks have a qualitative part and a quantitative part, represented by local knowledge bases. The general idea is to study how a fusion of these two formalisms would permit representing compact way to solve efficiently problems for knowledge representation. We show how to apply possibility and necessity measures to the problem of knowledge representation with large scale data. On the other hand fuzzification of crisp certainty degrees to fuzzy variables improves the quality of the network and tends to bring smoothness and robustness in the network performance. The general aim is to provide a new approach for decision under uncertainty that combines three methodologies: Bayesian networks certainty distribution and fuzzy logic .

      "text" : "Bayesian networks have attracted much attention recently as a possible solution to complex problems related to decision support under uncertainty. These networks are systems for uncertain knowledge representation and have a big number of applications with efficient algorithms and have strong theoretical foundations [1],[2],[3],[4],[5] and [11]. They use graphs capturing causality notion between variables, and probability theory (statistic data) to express the causality power.\nAlthough the underlying theory has been around for a long time, the possibility of building and executing realistic models has only been made possible because of recent improvements on algorithms and the availability of fast electronic computers. On the other hand, one of the main limits of Bayesian networks is necessity to provide a large number of numeric data; a constraint often difficult to satisfy when the number of random variables grows up. The goal of this paper is to develop a qualitative framework where the uncertainty is represented in possibility theory; an ordinal theory for uncertainty developed since more than ten years [6], [7], and [8]. Our framework propose to define a qualitative notion of independence (alternative to the probability theory), to propose techniques of decomposition of\njoined possibility distributions, and to develop some efficient algorithms for the revision of beliefs. Thus, on the first hand limitations of quantitative structure in Bayesian networks that use simple random variables have been noted by many researches. These limitations have motivated a variety of recent research in hierarchical and composable Bayesian models.\nOn the other hand, another limitation of the use of probabilistic Bayesian networks in expert systems is difficulty of obtaining realistic probabilities. So to solve these problems we use a new modified possibilistic Bayesian method. Our new modified possibilistic Bayesian networks simultaneously make use of both possibilistic measures: necessity measure and possibility measure.\nOur work extends and refines these proposed frameworks in a number of crucial ways. The language defined in [12] [13] and in [15] has been modified to enhance usability and to support a more powerful system. We are trying in this paper to describe a language that provides the important capability of uncertainty modeling. We have also combined different element from works cited above to describe our possibilistic networks based on local necessity-valued knowledge bases.\nWSEAS TRANS. on INFORMATION SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS Issue 2, Volume 3, February 2006 ISSN: 1790-0832\n225\nIn this paper we consider a type of possibilistic network that is based on the context model interpretation of a degree of possibility and focused on imprecision [14]. The first section presents an overview of standard possibilistic networks and their extensions. The following section describes our contribution with the use of necessity-valued knowledge bases as quantitative representation for uncertainty in nodes. And eventually we will talk about the transformations between average fuzzyBayesian networks and average knowledge bases.\n2 Necessity-possibility measures and\npossibilistic networks\nIn order to be able to discuss our framework for possibilistic networks we shall in this section give a few preliminary definitions and notational conventions. At the same time, we present a brief outline of few important notations and ideas in possibility theory and possibilistic networks relevant to the subject of this paper."

Ω is the set of classical interpretations\nω of L, and [p] is the set of classical models of p (i.e,\ninterpretations where p is true {ω | ω p}) [13].\n2.1.1 Possibility-necessity distributions and\npossibility-necessity measures\nThe basic element of possibility theory is the possibility\ndistribution ∏ which is a mapping from Ω to the interval\n[0 1]. The degree π(ω) represents the compatibility of ω with the available information (or beliefs) about the real\nworld. By convention, π(ω)= 0 means that the\ninterpretation ω is impossible, and π(ω) = 1 means that\nnothing prevents ω from being the real world [13].\nGiven a possibility distribution π, two different ways of rank ordering formulae of the language are defined from this possibility distribution. This is obtained using two mappings grading, respectively, the possibility and the certainty of a formula p:\n• The possibility (or consistency) degree:\n∏(p) = max ( π (ω) : ω ∈ [p]) (1)\nWhich evaluates the extent to which p is consistent with the available beliefs expressed by p [16]. It satisfies:\n∀p, ∀q ∏(p∨ q) = max (∏ (p), ∏ (q)) (2)\n• The necessity (or certainty, entailment) degree\nN(P) = 1 - ∏(¬p) (3) Which evaluates the extent to which p is entailed by the available beliefs. We have [17]: ∀p, ∀q N (p∧q) = max (N(p), N (q)) (4)\nTo note here that in our case, we consider that both necessity degree and possibility degrees for a given formulae should be given by an expert. On the other hand, when a data is required (a possibility degree or necessity degree) one should deduce it by applying equation (3)."

As the formal representation of the knowledge base, we use a set of possibilistic formulae. We represent random variables with necessities and possibilities weights and restrict ourselves to using only the average of these two measures.\nFormally an average necessity-possibility valued knowledge base is defined as the set :\n∑= {(ϕι , αi, βi) , i = 1….m} (9)\nWhere ϕι denotes a classical propositional formula, αi and βi denote respectively the lower bound of certainty (i.e necessity) and the lower bound of possibility.\nWe can represent the information contained in each node of a Bayesian network, as well as the quantitative information contained in the link matrices, if we can represent all the direct parent/child relations. We express the relation between each random variable and its parents over a class of networks with a collection of quantified formulae. The collection of formulae represents the relation between the random variable and its parents for any ground instantiation of the quantified variables. The network fragment consisting of a random variable and its parents with a set of formulae of the\nform (ϕ , α ,β).\nWe give next some definitions inspired from [12] and [13].\nDefinition 1: Two average knowledge bases ∑A1 and and ∑ A 2 are said to be equivalent if their associated possibility distributions (respectively necessity distributions) are equal, namely:\n∀ω ∈Ω, π∑A1 (ω) = π∑ A 2 (ω) and (10) ∀ω ∈Ω, N∑A1 (ω) = N∑ A 2 (ω)\nDefinition 2: Let (ϕ , α ,β) a formula in ∑A Then (ϕ , α ,β) is said to be subsumed by ∑A if ∑A and ∑A\\{(ϕ , α ,β)} are equivalent knowledge bases.\nThis is means that each redundant formula should be removed from the average valued knowledge base since it can be deduced from the rest of formulae.\n5 From fuzzy Bayesian network to fuzzy\nknowledge base In this section, we describe the process that permit to deduce an average valued knowledge base from an average network.\nLet ΠGA be an average and necessary Bayesian network consisting of a set of labeled variables V= {A1,A2,..An}.

However in order to perform reasoning for both imprecise and uncertain information, two important issues should be addressed. First, any improvement of the possibility level for a piece of information can only be achieved at the expense of the specificity of the information; second the accorded levels to the causality explained in terms of rules (case of fuzzy logic) and conditional dependencies (case of Bayesian networks) are somewhat expensive due to the fact that these confidence level is somewhat critical.\nWe propose so to combine these three approaches (Bayesian networks certainty distribution and fuzzy logic) to develop a method for uncertain and imprecise knowledge representation that may improve decision based systems.\nOur fuzzy beliefs are to emulate a certain Bayesian necessity measure.

This paper proposes a framework that combines two disciplines to exploit their own advantages in uncertain and imprecise knowledge representation problems. The framework proposed is a possibilistic logic based one in which Bayesian nodes and their properties are represented by local necessity-valued knowledge base. Data in properties are interpreted as set of valuated formulas. In our contribution possibilistic Bayesian networks have a qualitative part and a quantitative part, represented by local knowledge bases. The general idea is to study how a fusion of these two formalisms would permit representing compact way to solve efficiently problems for knowledge representation. We show how to apply possibility and necessity measures to the problem of knowledge representation with large scale data. On the other hand fuzzification of crisp certainty degrees to fuzzy variables improves the quality of the network and tends to bring smoothness and robustness in the network performance. The general aim is to provide a new approach for decision under uncertainty that combines three methodologies: Bayesian networks certainty distribution and fuzzy logic .
