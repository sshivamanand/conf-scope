      "text" : "The Bayesian Network (BN) [Pearl, 1988] formalism is one of the dominant representations for modeling uncertainty in intelligent systems [Neapolitan, 1990, Russell and Norvig, 1995]. A BN is a probabilistic graphical model of a joint probability distribution over a set of statistical variables. Bayesian inference on a BN answers probabilistic queries about the variables and their influence relationships. The posterior probability distribution is computed using belief updating methods [Pearl, 1988, Guo and Hsu, 2002]. Exact inference is NP-hard [Cooper, 1990]. Thus, exact methods only admit relatively small networks or simple network configurations in the worst case. Approximations are also NP-hard [Dagum and Luby, 1993]. However, approximate inference methods have anytime [Garvey and Lesser, 1994] and/or anywhere [Santos et al., 1995] properties that make these methods more attractive compared to exact methods.\nStochastic simulation algorithms, also called stochastic sampling or Monte Carlo (MC) algorithms, form one of the most prominent subclasses of approximate inference algorithms of which Logic Sampling [Henrion, 1988] was the first and simplest sampling algorithm. Likelihood weighting [Fung and Chang, 1989] was designed to overcome the poor performance of logic sampling under evidential reasoning with unlikely evidence. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) forms another important group of stochastic sampling algorithms. Examples in this group are Gibbs sampling, Metropolis sampling and hybrid-MC sampling [Geman and Geman, 1984, Gilks et al., 1996, MacKay, 1998, Pearl, 1987, Chavez and Cooper, 1990]. Stratified sampling [Bouckaert, 1994], hypercube sampling [Cheng and Druzdzel, 2000c], and quasi-MC methods [Cheng and Druzdzel, 2000b] generate random samples from uniform distributions using various methods to improve sampling results. The importance sampling methods [Rubinstein, 1981] are widely used in Bayesian inference. Self Importance Sampling (SIS) [Shachter and Peot, 1990] and Adaptive Importance Sampling (AIS-BN) [Cheng and Druzdzel, 2000a] are among the most effective algorithms.\nIn this paper we prove that the importance functions of an evidence-updated BN can only approach the optimal importance function when the BN graph structure is modified according to the observed evidence. This implies the existence of a collection of importance functions with minimum divergence to the optimal importance function under evidential reasoning. Based on this result we derive our Refractor Importance Sampling (RIS) class of algorithms. In contrast to AIS-BN and SIS methods, RIS removes the lower bound that prevents the updated importance function to approach the optimal importance function. This is achieved by a graphical structure “refractor”, consisting of a localized network structure change that minimizes the divergence between the evidence-adjusted importance function and the optimal importance function.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 proves the existence of a lower bound on the divergence to the optimal importance function under evidential reasoning with a BN. The lower bound is used to derive the class of RIS algorithms introduced in Section 3. Section 4 empirically verifies the properties of the RIS algorithms on a large set of synthetic networks and two real-world networks, and compares the results to other importance sampling algorithms. Finally, Section 5 summarizes our conclusions and describes our future work."

Pr is the joint probability distribution over the discrete random variables (vertices) V defined by Pr(V) =∏ V ∈V Pr(V | π(V )). The set of parents of a vertex V is π(V ). The conditional probability tables (CPT) of the BN assign values to Pr(V | π(V )) for all V ∈ V.\nThe graph G induces the d-separation criterion [Pearl, 1988], denoted by 〈X,Y | Z〉, which implies that X and Y are conditionally independent in Pr given Z, with X,Y,Z ⊆ V.\nDef. 2 Let BN = (G,Pr) be a Bayesian network.\n• The combined parent set of X ⊆ V is defined by π(X) = ⋃ X∈X π(X ) \\X.\n• Let An(·) denote the transitive closure of π(·), i.e. the ancestor set of a vertex.

      "text" : "Importance sampling is an MC method to improve the convergence speed and reduce the error variance with probability density functions. Let g(X) be a function of m variables X = {X1, . . . , Xm} over domain Ω ⊆ IRm, such that computing g(X) for any X is feasible. Consider the problem of approximating I =∫\nΩ g(X)dX using a sampling technique. Importance\nsampling approaches this problem by rewriting I =∫ Ω g(X) f(X)f(X)dX, where f(X) is a probability density function over Ω, often referred to as the importance function. In order to achieve minimum error variance equal to σ2f(X) = ( ∫ Ω |g(X)|dX)2 − I2, the importance\nfunction should be f(X) = |g(X)|( ∫\nΩ |g(X)|dX)−1, see\n[Rubinstein, 1981]. Note that when g(X) > 0 the optimal probability density function is f(X) = g(X)I−1 and σ2f(X) = 0. It is obvious that in most of cases it is impossible to obtain the optimal importance function.\nThe SIS [Shachter and Peot, 1990] and AIS-BN [Cheng and Druzdzel, 2000a] sampling algorithms are effective methods for approximate Bayesian inference. These methods attempt to approach the optimal importance function through learning by dynamically adjusting the importance function during sampling with evidence. To this end, AIS-BN heuristically changes the CPT values of a BN, a technique that has been shown to significantly improve the convergence rate of the approximation to the exact solution.\nWe use the following definitions for sake of exposition.\nDef. 3 Let BN = (G,Pr) be a Bayesian network with G = (V,A) and evidence e for variables E ⊆ V. A posterior BN e of the BN is some (new) network defined as BN e = (Ge,Pre) with graph Ge over variables V\\E, such that BN e exactly models the posterior joint probability distribution Pre = Pr(· | e).\nA typical example of a posterior BN e is a BN combined with an updated posterior state as defined by exact inference algorithms, e.g. using evidence absorption [van der Gaag, 1996]. Approximations of BN e are used by importance sampling algorithms. These approximations consist of the original BN with all evidence vertices ignored from further consideration.\nDef. 4 Let BN = (G,Pr) be a Bayesian network with G = (V,A) and evidence e for variables E ⊆ V. The evidence-simplified ESBN e of BN is defined by ESBN e = (G′e,Pr ′ e), where G ′ e = (V ′ e, A ′ e), V ′ e =\nV \\E, and A′e = {(X,Y ) | (X,Y ) ∈ A ∧ X,Y /∈ E}.\nThe joint probability distribution Pr′e of an evidencesimplified BN approximates Pre. For example, SIS and AIS-BN adjust the CPTs of the original BN."

The lower bound is valid for all variations of Pr′e, including those generated by importance sampling algorithms that adjust the CPT.\nTheorem 1 Let ESBN e = (G′e,Pr ′ e) be an evidencesimplified BN given evidence e for E ⊆ V. If Pr′e(V | πe(V )) = Pr(V | π(V ), e)) for all V ∈ V then the KLdivergence between Pre and Pr′e is minimal and given by ∑\nX∈X ∑ Cfg(X,π(X)) Pr(x, π(x) | e) ln Pr(x | π(x)) +\n∑ X∈X ∑ Cfg(X,π(X)) Pr(x, π(x) | e) ln 1 Pr′e(x | πe(x)) +\n∑ Cfg(π(E)) Pr(π(e) | e) ln ∏ e∈e Pr(e | π(e))− ln Pr(e) (1)\nwhere X = V \\E.\nProof. See Appendix A. 2\nTheorem 1 bounds the error variance from below, which is empirically verified for SIS and AIS-BN in the results Section 4. The divergence Eq. (1) is zero when specific conditions are met as stated below.\nCorollary 1 Let ESBN e = (G′e,Pr ′ e) be an evidencesimplified BN given evidence e for E ⊆ V. If π(E) ∩ (V \\E) = ∅, then Pr′e = Pre.\nProof. See Appendix B. 2\nHence, the optimal importance function is obtained when all evidence vertices are clustered as roots in G.\nWe will now show how Pr′e can approach the optimal Pre without restrictions. For sake of explanation, the following widely-held assumptions are reiterated:\nAssumption 1 The topological order δ of a BN and its posterior version δe of BN e are consistent. That is, δe(Y ) < δe(X)→ δ(Y ) < δ(X) for all X,Y ∈ V \\E.\nAssumption 1 is reasonable for the following facts:\n1. According to chain rule, a BN can be built up in any topological order and all of them describe the same joint probability distribution.\n2. Although there has never been a widely accepted definition of what causality is, it is widely accepted that the fact of observing evidence for random variables should not change the causality relationship between the variables.\nTheorem 2 Let BN e(Ge,Pre) be the posterior of a BN = (G,Pr) given evidence e for E ⊆ V. If X /∈ An(E) for all X ∈ V \\ E, then Pre(X | Ahe(X)) = Pr(X | π(X)). The evidence vertices in π(X) take configurations fixed by e, that is Pr(X | π(X)) = Pr(X | π(X) \\E, e1, . . . , em) for all ei ∈ π(X) ∩E.\nProof. See [Cheng and Druzdzel, 2000a]. 2\nHence, to compute the posterior probability of a vertex that is not an ancestor of an evidence vertex, there is no need to change the parents of the vertex or its CPT. For vertices that are ancestors of evidence vertices, we use Bayes’ formula and d-separation to explore the effects of evidence on those vertices. Without loss of generality, only one evidence vertex is considered. The result applies to an evidence vertex set by transitivity.\nLemma 1 Let BN e(Ge,Pre) be the posterior of a BN = (G,Pr) given evidence e = {e} for E ∈ V. Let X ∈ An(E). Then, Pre(X | Ahe(X)) = Pr(e|X,Ah(X)) Pr(e|Ah(X)) Pr(X | π(X)).\nProof. Because Ahe(X) = Ah(X) by Assumption 1, we have Pre(X | Ahe(X)) = Pre(X,Ah(X)) Pre(Ah(X)) = Pr(X,Ah(X)|e)Pr(Ah(X)|e) = Pr(X,Ah(X),e) Pr(Ah(X),e) = Pr(e|X,Ah(X)) Pr(X,Ah(X)) Pr(e|Ah(X)) Pr(Ah(X)) = Pr(e|X,Ah(X)) Pr(e|Ah(X)) Pr(X | π(X)) by using Theorem 2. 2\nTheorem 2 and Lemma 1 show that if we have Pr(e | X,Ah(X)) and Pr(e | Ah(X)) for all X ∈ An(E) we can derive Pre(X | Ahe(X)) to compute Pre(V) =∏ V ∈An(E) Pr(V | π(V )) ∏ V 6∈An(E) Pre(V | Ahe(V )) for the optimal importance function. However, there are two problems to derive Pre. Firstly, Ah(X) is too large to construct a posterior BNe for Pre in practice. Secondly, instead of the exact Pre(X | Ahe(X)) we have an estimate by importance sampling.\nThe parent sets of X ∈ An(E ) can be minimized by exploiting d-separation. Let αe(X) ⊆ X ∪ Ah(X) denote the minimal vertex set that d-separates evidence E and X ∪ Ah(X), thus 〈E,X ∪ Ah(X) | αe(X)〉. We will refer to αe(X) as the “shield” of X given E. Let βe(X) ⊆ Ah(X) denote the minimal vertex set that d-separates evidence E and Ah(X), thus 〈E,Ah(X) | βe(X)〉. We explore the relationship between αe(X) and βe(X) below.\nLemma 2 Let BN e(Ge,Pre) be the posterior of a BN = (G,Pr) given evidence e = {e} for E ∈ V. Then, βe(X) ⊆ (αe(X)\\X)∪π(X) for all X ∈ An(E).\nProof. See Appendix C. 2\nTherefore, we can approach the optimal importance function Pre(X | Ahe(X)) by estimation of Pre(X | (αe(X) \\X) ∪ π(X)) from importance samples.\nInput: Evidence E ∈ V and X ∈ An(E) Output: The set S = αe(X) Data: array A, queue Q A← topSortδ(Ah(X)); S ← {X}; for i← |A| to 1 do\nQ← ∅; push(Q, A[i]); while Q 6= ∅ do\nV ← pop(Q); if V = E then S ← S ∪ {A[i]}; break; if V 6∈ S ∧ V ∈ An(E) ∧X 6∈ An(V ) then\npush(children(V )); end\nend end\nAlgorithm 1: Computing the Shield αe(X)"

This increases the complexity of the BN. However, the effect of evidence on other vertices is attenuated when the path length between the evidence and the vertices is increased [Henrion, 1989]. Therefore, instead of modifying all ancestors An(E) of evidence E in Step 1, it is generally sufficient to select a subset of ancestors such as the combined parent set π(E).\nSteps 1 and 2 are independent, because any importance function learning algorithm can be applied in Step 2. Steps 2 and 3 can be combined by using the same importance sampling algorithm for learning and inference. In our experiments, we used SIS and AISBN for both learning and inference (steps 2 and 3), referred to as RISSIS and RISAIS, respectively. AISBN will be referred to by AIS."

(1).\nThe number of samples is taken as a measure of running time instead of CPU time in our experimental implementation. Recall that the overhead of RIS is fixed at startup when the evidence set can be predetermined. Furthermore, the RIS overhead is limited to collecting the updated CPT values during sampling (and learning in the case of RISAIS).\nThe reported sampling frequencies for AIS (and RISAIS) are for calculating the posterior results. Because AIS separates the importance function learning stage from the sampling stage, the actual number of samples taken for AIS (total sampling for importance function and sampling the results) is twice that of SIS.

The probability distributions of these networks are more extreme compared to the synthetic BNs. For each of the two BNs, 20 sets of evidence variables are randomly chosen, each with 10 evidence variables.

Recall that the PostKLD is the lower bound on the KL-divergence of AIS. From the figure it can be concluded that AIS does not approach the exact solution for a significant number of test cases, whereas RISAIS is not limited by the bound due to the BN refractoring.\nIt should be noted that around points 1 and 26 in Fig. 3 the KL-divergence of RISAIS is worse compared to AIS. We believe the reason is that AIS heuristically changes the original CPT which has a negative impact on the RIS algorithm’s ability to adjust the CPT to the optimal importance function.\nFig. 4 shows the result for RISSIS, where the 100 BNs are ranked according to the PostKLD. Interestingly,\nthe RISSIS and SIS results are better on average than RISAIS and AIS. Note that the PostKLD lower bound is the same for AIS and SIS.

We have ∑ Cfg(Xj) Pr′e(xj | πe(xj))\n= ∑\nCfg(Xj) Pr′e(xj | π(xj) \\ e) = 1. According to\nShannon’s information theory [Shannon, 1956], to minimize ∑ Cfg(Xj)\nPr(xj | π(xj), e) ln 1Pr′e(xj |π(xj)\\e) we should set Pr′e(xj | π(xj) \\ e) = Pr(xj | π(xj), e).

We prove the existence of a collection of importance functions that are close to the optimal importance function under evidential reasoning. Based on this theoretic result we derive the RIS algorithm. RIS approaches the optimal importance function by applying localized arc changes to minimize the divergence between the evidence-adjusted importance function and the optimal importance function. The validity and performance of RIS is empirically tested with a large set of synthetic Bayesian networks and two realworld networks.",
