      "text" : "Numerous temporal inference tasks such as fault monitoring and anomaly detection exhibit a persistence property: for example, if something breaks, it stays broken until an intervention. When modeled as a Dynamic Bayesian Network, persistence adds dependencies between adjacent time slices, often making exact inference over time intractable using standard inference algorithms. However, we show that persistence implies a regular structure that can be exploited for efficient inference. We present three successively more general classes of models: persistent causal chains (PCCs), persistent causal trees (PCTs) and persistent polytrees (PPTs), and the corresponding exact inference algorithms that exploit persistence. We show that analytic asymptotic bounds for our algorithms compare favorably to junction tree inference; and we demonstrate empirically that we can perform exact smoothing on the order of 100 times faster than the approximate Boyen-Koller method on randomly generated instances of persistent tree models. We also show how to handle non-persistent variables and how persistence can be exploited effectively for approximate filtering."

      "text" : "Persistence is a common trait of many real-world systems. It is used to model permanent changes in state, such as when components of a system that have broken until someone intervenes to fix them. Especially interesting and useful are diagnostic models where misalignments and other process drifts may cause a cascade of other failures, all of which may also persist until the root cause is fixed. Even when such changes are not truly permanent, they are often reversed slowly\nrelative to the time scale of the model, and persistence can be a good approximation in such systems. For instance, vehicular accidents cause obstructions on the road that last much longer than the required detection time and are thus persistent for the purpose of detection [20]. Another example is outbreak detection [4], where an infected population stays infected much longer than the desired detection time. There are many other examples of persistence and approximate persistence.\nDynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) [5] are a general formalism for modeling temporal systems under uncertainty. Many standard time-series methods are special cases of DBNs, including Hidden Markov Models [18] and Kalman filters [7]. Discrete DBNs in particular are a very popular formalism, but usually suffer from intractability [1] when dense inter-temporal dependencies are present among hidden state variables, leading many to search for approximation algorithms [1, 13, 15, 14]. Unfortunately, modeling persistence with DBNs requires the introduction of many inter-temporal arcs, often making exact inference intractable with standard inference algorithms.\nIn this paper, we define Persistent Causal DBNs (PCDBNs), a particular class of DBN models capable of modeling many real-world systems that involve long chains of causal influence coupled with persistence of causal effects. We show that a linear time algorithm exists for inference (smoothing) in linear chain and tree-based PC-DBNs. We then generalize our results to polytree causal networks, where the algorithm remains exact, and to general networks, where it inherits properties of loopy belief propagation [21]. Our method relies on a transformation of the original prototype network, allowing smoothing to be done efficiently; however, this method does not readily deal with the incremental filtering problem. Nonetheless, we show empirically that, if evidence is observed at every time slice, approximate filtering can be accomplished with fixed window smoothing, producing lower error than approximate Boyen-Koller (BK) filtering [1]\nusing a fraction of the computation time.\nThe algorithm that we present exploits a particular type of determinism that is given by the persistence relation. There has been other work that seeks to directly or indirectly exploit general deterministic structure in Bayesian networks using compilation approaches [2], a generalized version belief propagation [10], and variable elimination with algebraic decision diagrams [3, 19]. These more general methods have not been tailored to the important special cases of DBNs and persistency. To our knowledge, this is the first work to investigate persistency in DBNs.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we introduce the changepoint transformation. Section 3 introduces persistent causal chain DBNs and the corresponding inference algorithm, which retains all the essential properties of later models. Then, Section 4 will discuss the steps leading to a fully general algorithm. Experimental results are presented in Section 5, followed by conclusions."

      "text" : "Consider a Bayesian network (BN) with N binary variables Xi; we will refer to this network as the prototype. The corresponding Dynamic BN with M slices is created by replicating the prototype M times and connecting some of the variables to their copies in the next slice. In our notation, upper indices range over time slices of the DBN; lower indices range over variables in each time slice. Colon notation is used to denote sets and sequences. Thus, for instance, X1:M4 denotes the entire temporal sequence of values of X4 from time 1 to time M . Variables without an upper index will refer to their respective counterparts in the prototype. We say that a variable Xk is persistent if P (Xtk = 1|Xt−1k , U t) = { P (Xk|U) if Xt−1k = 0\n1 if Xt−1k = 1 ,\n(1) where U = Pa(Xk) refers to the parents of Xk in the prototype. In other words, 1 is an absorbing state. Sometimes [12] a variable is called persistent if it has an arc to the next-slice copy of itself. Our definition of persistence is strictly stronger, but no confusion should arise in this paper.\nThere are 2M temporal sequences of values of a binary variableXk. If the variable is persistent, the number of configurations is reduced to M+1. Information about X1:Mk can be summarized by looking at the time when X changed from 0 to 1 (we sometimes refer to the 0 state as the off state and 1 as the on state). Thus, inference in the persistent DBN with binary variables is equivalent to inference in a network whose topology closely resembles that of the prototype and whose\nvariables are M+1-ary discrete changepoint variables, with correspondingly defined conditional probability distributions (CPDs), as shown in Figure 1b. The models in Figure 1a and 1b are identical; one can go back and forth between them by recognizing that\n(X̃ = j) ⇔ (Xj = 0) ∧ (Xj+1 = 1) and (Xj = 0) ⇔ (X̃ > j).\nIf the prototype is a tree, belief propagation in the transformed network yields an algorithm whose complexity is O(M2N). The quadratic part of the computation comes from summing over the M + 1 values of the single parent for each of the M + 1 values of the child. Similarly, if the prototype is a polytree, complexity will be proportional to MUmax+1, where Umax is the largest in-degree in the network. This transformation by itself, when all hidden state variables are persistent, allows us to perform smoothing much more efficiently than by operating on the original DBN. There is, however, additional structure in the CPDs that allows us to do better by a factor of M , and we can also adapt our algorithm to deal with the case when some hidden variables are not persistent."

This is a chain with Pa(Xi) = {Xi−1}, i = 1, ..., N and Pa(O) = XN (thus it has N+1 nodes). Let us further assume that the leaves are nonpersistent and observed, while the causes (X nodes) are all persistent and hidden. The network is shown in Figure 1a and its transformed version in Figure 1b.\nConsider the problem of computing P (O). This is in general one of the most difficult inference problems, requiring one to integrate out all hidden state variables, and is implicit in most inference queries:\nP(O1:M ) = ∑\nX1:M1:N\nP(O1:M | X1:M1:N ) · P(X1:M1:N ) (2)\nLet {jk : 0 ≤ jk ≤ M} index the sequence of X1:Mk in which variable Xjkk is the last (highest-time) variable to be in the off state, unless jk = 0 in which case it indexes the sequence in which all Xk are in the on state. As an example, if M = 3, then jk = {0, 1, 2, 3} indexes the statesX1:Mk = {111, 011, 001, 000}, respectively, for all k. All configurations not indexed by ji have zero probability due to the persistence assumption. To simplify notation, we use jk to denote the event that X1:Mk is the sequence indexed by jk. We also say that Xk fired at jk.

Using this notation, Equation 3 can be rewritten as:\nP (O1:M ) = M∑\nj1=0\nP(j1) · Σj12 (5)\nNow we now need to show that one can calculate the entire set Σ0:M2:N in time O(MN). Each Σ L k can be written as follows:\nΣLk = σ̄ L k + σ L k + σ̂ L k , (6)\nwhere σ̄Lk contains all the terms in the sum such that Xk first fires when Xk−1 has not fired:\nσ̄Lk = ∑\njk<L\nP̂ jk k P̂k · Σjkk+1.

(21)\nIt is now useful to recall the types of potentials involved in Pearl’s algorithm [8] and how they relate to the quantities above. For each node X, there are local potentials πX(x) ≡def p(X = x|e+X) and λX(x) ≡def p(e−X |X = x), where e+X and e−X denote respectively the evidence reachable through parents and the evidence reachable from X “downwards”, X included. There are two types of messages in Pearl’s algorithm: πX→Yi sent by X to its children and λX→Ui sent to its parents. A closer look at PCC-DBN reveals that each Σk is identical to λXk→Xk−1 — the message from Xk to its single parent Xk−1. The local potential λXk(jk) is identical to Σk+1, because there are no children other than Xk+1 and evidence is only observed at the bottom of the chain. Ψk corresponds directly to πXk(jk).

      "text" : "While PCC-DBNs are useful for demonstrating the general ideas of handling the probability distributions arising from the changepoint transformation, they form a rather restricted class of networks, and the inference query that we performed was also restricted. Here we state succinctly a set of simple alterations which allow this algorithm to be relaxed in various ways:\nGeneral evidence patterns We can have observations anywhere in the network, in any time slice.\nCasting the inference as belief propagation gives the answer to any probabilistic query as Equation 21 with one caveat: An observation such as X33 = 1 does not tell us with certainty the position of the changepoint, but it just provides evidence that j3 < 3, thus we cannot simply set the changepoint variable to state 3. Rather, the potentials corresponding to such evidence must be multiplied onto the messages as prescribed by the belief propagation algorithm (see Equation 22).\nNon-stationarity Stationarity of conditional probability distributions was used to simplify the formulae in the previous exposition, but is not required. All that is needed is to keep running products of respective probabilities instead of the powers in the exponents of Pk, P̂k. They need to be computed incrementally and tabulated to avoid hidden linear terms in the computation.\nExtension to trees The extension of PCC-DBN to causal trees (PCT-DBNs) is now fairly straightforward. Because each node Xk can now have multiple children Ch(Xk), we must replace Σk in all recurrences with the true λ-potential for Xk:\nλXk = λXk→Xk · ∏\ni∈Ch(Xk) Σi, (22)\nwhere λXk→Xk accounts for evidence observed in Xk’s temporal chain. The vector λXk→Xk is zero where the evidence rules out a changepoint — before the time t of the last observed Xtk = 0 and after the time s of first observed Xsk = 1. Everywhere else, λXk→Xk(jk) = 1. Note that λX(x) potential can be obtained in O(M) time per node.\nIn computation of ψ potentials, Ψk on the right-hand side of the recurrences is replaced by the πPa(Xk)→Xk , which in turn include the influence of evidence under Xk’s siblings:\nπPa(Xk)→Xk = πXk · ∏\ni∈Ch(Pa(Xk))\\Xk Σi.

Polytrees, unlike\ntrees, allow multiple parents of a node, but remain acyclic in the undirected sense. In polytree changepoint networks, structure in the conditional probability table P (X = x|U) can be exploited to save a multiplicative factor of M + 1 just as we showed for tree networks. The ψ-recurrences run over the first parent variable, while the remaining parents are summed over by brute force. Similarly, the σ-recurrences run over the parent that the message is addressed to.

The proportionality constant in Equation 24 equals the product of the remaining parents’ π-messages. We call this PPT-DBN, the persistent polytree algorithm.\nThe worst-case time complexity of PPT-DBN is dominated by the cost associated with the largest familyclique: O((M + 1)Umax). The 2TBN algorithm [12] suffers a worst-case time complexity O(22NM), as all nodes in two slices may be entangled [9] in the clique to connect the two subsequent time-slices, even though the prototype network is a polytree [12, section 3.6.2]. Therefore, we expect PPT-DBN will be comparatively better for shorter temporal chains of larger networks. However, PPT-DBN really shines on space complexity. At most O(MN) memory is consumed, compared to 2TBN, where the potentials in the joint tree can grow as large as O(22N ). Later we show experimentally how dramatic the difference can be."

We make this assumption in order to avoid having to invoke an embedded general DBN inference\nalgorithm such as 2TBN to handle connected nonpersistent variables. It can be done, but quickly becomes complex and inelegant. A simple way to handle connected non-persistent nodes is to combine them into a single joint node. Obviously, this solution causes exponential growth in the state space of the joined nodes, making it somewhat unappealing.

We use a binary tree prototype with all leaf variables nonpersistent and observed. All non-leaf variables are persistent and hidden. The CPT probabilities are sampled uniformly at random. The observed evidence O is obtained by forward-sampling the DBN and restricting it to the observables. We find that the error of our algorithm falls with growing W as expected. The results become even more favorable for PC-DBN as N, the number of nodes per slice, grows (see also further results online). The error made by fixing the inference window tends to be lower than that of the Boyen-Koller approximation for reasonable values of W and we can eliminate the unfavorable dependence on M at a small price of accuracy. One clear drawback to a naive implementation of the fixed-window approach is that if evidence is not observed at each time slice, in the presence of persistence a piece of crucial evidence might drop off the window preventing the model from “remembering” that a persistent state was already acheived. This glitch could in principle be fixed by caching when persistent variables have turned on."

      "text" : "We presented an algorithm for PC-DBNs, a way to exploit the special structure of the DBN probability distribution when many variables are persistent. Unlike forward-backward approaches to DBN inference that work slice-to-slice, we collapse the entire temporal progression and perform inference in the original prototype network structure. For trees, the algorithm is many times faster than state-of-the-art general-purpose exact and approximate DBN inference algorithms, while having a space complexity of only\nO(MN). This continues to hold even in the polytree generalization with inference window lengths into the hundreds. While this method does not directly yield an incremental filtering algorithm, we show that a fixed-window smoothing version of PC-DBN inference can perform approximate filtering faster and with comparable or less error than BK-filtering.\nAlthough we have not presented a filtering algorithm that can exploit persistence, we do believe that one is possible. The number of possible joint configurations of variables in two subsequent slices is 3N with the persistence assumption as opposed to 4N in the general network. This hints at the possibility of a 2TBN-like algorithm leveraging persistence and still remaining linear in the number of time slices.\nAnother possible direction for this work is to allow multi resolution temporal modeling by modeling systems on very short time scales, but utilizing a persistence approximation for the slow processes. In such cases, a model with a single time-scale could efficiently and accurately deal with systems that have both fast and slow processes.\nAlso interesting is the vision of approximate inference algorithms not requiring persistence, but simply assuming that the hidden state changes at most once in the period of interest. If the change in the hidden state is relatively slow, this could be a fairly accurate approximation. Such problems are often found in bioinformatics areas such as phylogeny discovery, where time of a mutation is of interest [6]."

When modeled as a Dynamic Bayesian Network, persistence adds dependencies between adjacent time slices, often making exact inference over time intractable using standard inference algorithms. However, we show that persistence implies a regular structure that can be exploited for efficient inference. We present three successively more general classes of models: persistent causal chains (PCCs), persistent causal trees (PCTs) and persistent polytrees (PPTs), and the corresponding exact inference algorithms that exploit persistence. We show that analytic asymptotic bounds for our algorithms compare favorably to junction tree inference; and we demonstrate empirically that we can perform exact smoothing on the order of 100 times faster than the approximate Boyen-Koller method on randomly generated instances of persistent tree models. We also show how to handle non-persistent variables and how persistence can be exploited effectively for approximate filtering.",
