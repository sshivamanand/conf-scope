    "abstractText" : "The currently most efficient algorithm for infer­ ence with a probabilistic network builds upon a triangulation of a network's graph. In this paper, we show that pre-processing can help in finding good triangulations for probabilistic networks, that is, triangulations with a minimal maximum clique size. We provide a set of rules for step­ wise reducing a graph. The reduction allows us to solve the triangulation problem on a smaller graph. From the smaller graph's triangulation, a triangulation of the original graph is obtained by reversing the reduction steps. Our experimental results show that the graphs of some well-known real-life probabilistic networks can be triangu­ lated optimally just by pre-processing; for other networks, huge reductions in size are obtained.",
