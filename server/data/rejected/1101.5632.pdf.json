      "heading" : "1. INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Research in multi-robot exploration and mapping has recently progressed from building occupancy grids [14] to sampling spatially varying environmental phenomena [6, 7], in particular, environmental fields (e.g., plankton density, pollutant concentration, temperature fields) that are characterized by continuous-valued, spatially correlated measurements (see Fig. 1). Exploration strategies for building occupancy grid maps usually operate under the assumptions of (a) discrete, (b) independent cell occupancies, which impose, respectively, the following limitations for learning environmental field maps: these strategies (a) cannot be fully informed by the continuous field measurements and (b) cannot exploit the spatial correlation structure of an environmental field for selecting observation paths. As a result, occupancy grid mapping strategies are not capable of selecting the most informative observation paths for learning an environmental field map.\nFurthermore, occupancy grid mapping strategies typically assume that range sensing is available. In contrast, many in situ environmental and ecological sensing applications (e.g., monitoring of ocean phenomena, forest ecosystems, or pollution) permit only point-based sensing, thus making a highresolution sampling of the entire field impractical in terms of resource costs (e.g., energy consumption, mission time). In practice, the resource cost constraints restrict the spatial coverage of the observation paths. Fortunately, the spatial correlation structure of an environmental field enables a map of the field (in particular, its unobserved areas) to be learned using the point-based observations taken along the resourceconstrained paths. To learn this map, a commonly-used approach in spatial statistics [15] is to assume that the environmental field is realized from a probabilistic model called the Gaussian process (GP) (Section 3.2). More importantly, the GP model allows an environmental field to be formally characterized and consequently provides formal measures of mapping uncertainty (e.g., based on mean-squared error [6] or entropy criterion [7]) for directing a robot team to explore highly uncertain areas of the field. In this paper, we focus on using the entropy criterion to measure mapping uncertainty.\nHow then does a robot team plan the most informative resource-constrained observation paths to minimize the mapping uncertainty of an environmental field? To address this, the work of [7] has proposed an information-theoretic multirobot exploration strategy that selects non-myopic observation paths with maximum entropy. Interestingly, this work has established an equivalence result that the maximumentropy paths selected by such a strategy can achieve the\nar X\niv :1\n10 1.\n56 32\nv1 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n2 8\nJa n\n20 11\ndual objective of minimizing the mapping uncertainty defined using the entropy criterion. When this strategy is applied to sampling a GP-based environmental field, it can be reduced to solving a non-Markovian, deterministic planning problem called the information-theoretic multi-robot adaptive sampling problem (iMASP) (Section 3). Due to the non-Markovian problem structure of iMASP, its state size grows exponentially with the length of planning horizon. To alleviate this computational difficulty, an anytime heuristic search algorithm called Learning Real-Time A∗ [2] is used to solve iMASP approximately. However, this algorithm does not guarantee the performance of its induced exploration policy. We have also observed through experiments that when the joint action space of the robot team is large or the planning horizon is long, it no longer produces a good policy fast enough. Even after incurring a huge amount of time and space to improve the search, its resulting policy still performs worse than the widely-used non-Markovian greedy policy, the latter of which can be derived efficiently by solving the myopic formulation of iMASP (Section 3.3).\nThough the anytime and greedy algorithms provide some computational relief to solving iMASP (albeit approximately), they inherit iMASP’s non-Markovian problem structure and consequently scale poorly with the length of history of observations. Hence, it becomes computationally impractical to use these non-Markovian path planning algorithms for in situ, real-time active sampling performed (a) at high resolution (e.g., due to high sensor sampling rate or large sampling region), (b) over dynamic features of interest (e.g., algal blooms, oil spills), (c) with resource cost constraints (e.g., energy consumption, mission time), or (d) in the presence of dynamically changing external forces translating the robots (e.g., ocean drift on autonomous boats), thus requiring fast replanning. For example, the deployment of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and boats for ocean sampling poses the above challenges/issues among others [4].\nTo ease this computational burden, this paper proposes a principled Markov-based approach to efficient informationtheoretic path planning for active sampling of GP-based environmental fields (Section 4), which we develop by assuming the Markov property in iMASP planning. To the probabilistic robotics community, such a move to achieve time efficiency is probably anticipated. However, the Markov property is often imposed without carefully considering or formally analyzing its consequence on the performance degradation while operating in non-Markovian environments. In particular, to what extent does the environmental structure affect the performance degradation due to violation of the Markov assumption? Motivated by this lack of treatment, our work in this paper is novel in demonstrating both theoretically and empirically the extent of which the degradation of active sampling performance depends on the spatial correlation structure of an environmental field. An important practical consequence is that of establishing environmental field conditions under which the Markov-based approach performs well relative to the non-Markovian iMASP-based policy while enjoying significant computational gain over it. The specific contributions of our work include: • analyzing the time complexity of solving the Markov-based\ninformation-theoretic path planning problem, and showing analytically that it scales better than that of deriving the non-Markovian strategies with increasing length of planning horizon (Section 4.1);\n• providing theoretical guarantees on the active sampling performance of our Markov-based policy (Section 4.2) for a class of exploration tasks called the transect sampling task (Section 2), from which various ideal environmental field conditions and sampling task settings can be established to limit its performance degradation; • empirically evaluating the active sampling performance\nand time efficiency of our Markov-based policy on realworld temperature and plankton density field data under less favorable realistic environmental field conditions and sampling task settings (Section 5)."

      "text" : "Fig. 1 illustrates the transect sampling task introduced in [11, 13] previously. A temperature field is spatially distributed over a 25 m × 150 m transect that is discretized into a 5 × 30 grid of sampling locations comprising 30 columns, each of which has 5 sampling locations. It can be observed that the number of columns is much greater than the number of sampling locations in each column; this observed property is assumed to be consistent with every other transect. The robots are constrained to simultaneously explore forward one column at a time from the leftmost to the rightmost column of the transect such that each robot samples one location per column for a total of 30 locations. So, each robot’s action space given its current location consists of moving to any of the 5 locations in the adjacent column on its right. The number of robots is assumed not to be larger than the number of sampling locations per column. We assume that an adversary chooses the starting robot locations in the leftmost column and the robots will only know them at the time of deployment; such an adversary can be the dynamically changing external forces translating the robots (e.g., ocean drift on autonomous boats) or the unknown obstacles occupying potential starting locations. The robots are allowed to end at any location in the rightmost column.\nIn practice, the constraint on exploring forward in a transect sampling task permits the planning of less complex observation paths that can be achieved more reliably, using less sophisticated control algorithms, and by robots with limited maneuverability (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles, autonomous boats and AUVs [9]). For practical applications, while the robot is in transit from its current location to a distant planned waypoint [4, 13], this task can be performed to collect the most informative observations during transit. In monitoring of ocean phenomena and freshwater quality along rivers, the transect can span a plankton density or temperature field drifting at a constant rate from right to left and the autonomous boats are tasked to explore within a line perpendicular to the drift. As another example, the transect can be the bottom surface of ship hull or other maritime structure to be inspected and mapped by AUVs."

      "heading" : "3.2 Gaussian Process-Based Environmental Field",
      "text" : "The GP model can be used to formally characterize an environmental field as follows: the environmental field is defined to vary as a realization of a GP. Let {Zu}u∈U denote a GP, i.e., every finite subset of {Zu}u∈U has a multivariate Gaussian distribution [8]. The GP is fully specified by its mean µu 4 = E[Zu] and covariance σuv 4 = cov[Zu, Zv] for all u, v ∈ U . We assume that the GP is second-order stationary, i.e., it has a constant mean and a stationary covariance structure (i.e., σuv is a function of u− v for all u, v ∈ U). In particular, its covariance structure is defined by the widelyused squared exponential covariance function [8]\nσuv 4 = σ2s exp { −1\n2 (u− v)>M−2(u− v)\n} + σ2nδuv (1)\nwhere σ2s is the signal variance, σ 2 n is the noise variance, M is a diagonal matrix with length-scale components `1 and `2 in the horizontal and vertical directions of a transect, respectively, and δuv is a Kronecker delta of value 1 if u = v, and 0 otherwise. Intuitively, the signal and noise variances describe, respectively, the intensity and noise of the field measurements while the length-scale can be interpreted as the approximate distance to be traversed in a transect for the field measurement to change considerably [8]; it therefore controls the degree of spatial correlation or “similarity” between field measurements. In this paper, the mean and covariance structure of the GP are assumed to be known. Given that the robot team has collected observations x0, zx0 , x1, zx1 , . . . , xi, zxi over stages 0 to i, the distribution of Zu remains Gaussian with the following posterior mean and covariance\nµu|x0:i = µu + Σux0:iΣ −1 x0:ix0:i{zx0:i − µx0:i} > (2)\nσuv|x0:i = σuv − Σux0:iΣ −1 x0:ix0:iΣx0:iv (3)\nwhere µx0:i is a row vector with mean components µw for every location w of x0:i, Σux0:i is a row vector with covariance components σuw for every location w of x0:i, Σx0:iv is a column vector with covariance components σwv for every location w of x0:i, and Σx0:ix0:i is a covariance matrix with components σwy for every pair of locations w, y of x0:i. Note that the posterior mean µu|x0:i (2) is the best unbiased predictor of the measurement zu at unobserved location u. An\nimportant property of GP is that the posterior covariance σuv|x0:i (3) is independent of the observed measurements zx0:i ; this property is used to reduce iMASP to a deterministic planning problem as shown later.\n3.3 Deterministic iMASP Planning Supposing the robot team starts in locations x0 of leftmost column 0, an exploration policy is responsible for directing it to sample locations x1, x2, . . . , xt+1 of the respective columns 1, 2, . . . , t + 1 to form the observation paths. Formally, a non-Markovian policy is denoted by π 4 = 〈π0(x0:0 = x0), π1(x0:1), . . . , πt(x0:t)〉 where πi(x0:i) maps the history x0:i of robots’ sampling locations to a vector ai ∈ A(xi) of robots’ actions in stage i (i.e., ai ← πi(x0:i)), and A(xi) is the joint action space of the robots given their current locations xi. We assume that the transition function τ(xi, ai) deterministically (i.e., no localization uncertainty) moves the robots to their next locations xi+1 in stage i + 1 (i.e., xi+1 ← τ(xi, ai)). Putting πi and τ together yields the assignment xi+1 ← τ(xi, πi(x0:i)).\nThe work of [7] has proposed a non-Markovian policy π∗ that selects non-myopic observation paths with maximum entropy for sampling a GP-based field. To know how π∗ is derived, we first define the value under a policy π to be the entropy of observation paths when starting in x0 and following π thereafter:\nV π0 (x0) 4 = H[Zx1:t+1 |Zx0 , π] = − ∫ f(zx0:t+1 |π) log f(zx1:t+1 |zx0 , π) dzx0:t+1\n(4) where f denotes a Gaussian probability density function. When a non-Markovian policy π is plugged into (4), the following (t+1)-stage recursive formulation results from the chain rule for entropy and xi+1 ← τ(xi, πi(x0:i)):\nV πi (x0:i) = H[Zxi+1 |Zx0:i , πi] + V π i+1(x0:i+1)\n= H[Zτ(xi,πi(x0:i))|Zx0:i ] + V π i+1((x0:i, τ(xi, πi(x0:i))))\nV πt (x0:t) = H[Zxt+1 |Zx0:t , πt] = H[Zτ(xt,πt(x0:t))|Zx0:t ]\n(5) for stage i = 0, . . . , t− 1 such that each stagewise posterior entropy (i.e., of the measurements Zxi+1 to be observed in stage i+1 given the history of measurements Zx0:i observed from stages 0 to i) reduces to\nH[Zxi+1 |Zx0:i ] = 1\n2 log (2πe)k|Σxi+1|x0:i | (6)\nwhere Σxi+1|x0:i is a covariance matrix with components σuv|x0:i for every pair of locations u, v of xi+1, each of which is independent of observed measurements zx0:i by (3), as discussed above. So, H[Zxi+1 |Zx0:i ] can be evaluated in closed form, and the value functions (5) only require the history of robots’ sampling locations x0:i as inputs but not that of corresponding measurements zx0:i .\nSolving iMASP involves choosing π to maximize V π0 (x0) (5), which yields the optimal policy π∗. Plugging π∗ into (5) gives the (t+ 1)-stage dynamic programming equations:\nV π ∗\ni (x0:i) = max ai∈A(xi)\nH[Zτ(xi,ai)|Zx0:i ] + V π∗ i+1((x0:i, τ(xi, ai)))\nV π ∗\nt (x0:t) = max at∈A(xt) H[Zτ(xt,at)|Zx0:t ]\n(7)\nfor stage i = 0, . . . , t− 1. Since each stagewise posterior entropy H[Zτ(xi,ai)|Zx0:i ] (6) can be evaluated in closed form as explained above, iMASP for sampling the GP-based field (7) reduces to a deterministic planning problem. Furthermore, it turns out to be the well-known maximum entropy sampling problem [10] as demonstrated in [7]. Policy π∗ = 〈π∗0(x0:0), . . . , π∗t (x0:t)〉 can be determined by\nπ∗i (x0:i) = arg max ai∈A(xi) H[Zτ(xi,ai)|Zx0:i ] + V π∗ i+1((x0:i, τ(xi, ai))) π∗t (x0:t) = arg max at∈A(xt) H[Zτ(xt,at)|Zx0:t ]\n(8) for stage i = 0, . . . , t− 1. Similar to the optimal value functions (7), π∗ only requires the history of robots’ sampling locations as inputs. So, π∗ can generate the maximum-entropy paths prior to exploration.\nSolving the myopic formulation of iMASP (7) is often considered to ease computation (Section 4.1), which entails deriving the non-Markovian greedy policy πG = 〈πG0 (x0:0), . . . , πGt (x0:t)〉 where, for stage i = 0, . . . , t,\nπGi (x0:i) = arg max ai∈A(xi) H[Zτ(xi,ai)|Zx0:i ] . (9)\nThe work of [3] has proposed a non-Markovian greedy policy πM = 〈πM0 (x0:0), . . . , πMt (x0:t)〉 to approximately maximize the closely related mutual information criterion:\nπMi (x0:i) = arg max ai∈A(xi) H[Zτ(xi,ai)|Zx0:i ]−H[Zτ(xi,ai)|Zx0:i+1 ] (10) for stage i = 0, . . . , t where x0:i+1 denotes the vector comprising locations of domain U not found in (x0:i, τ(xi, ai)). It is shown in [3] that πM greedily selects new sampling locations that maximize the increase in mutual information. As noted in [7], this strategy is deficient in that it may not necessarily minimize the mapping uncertainty defined using the entropy criterion. More importantly, it suffers a huge computational drawback: the time needed to derive πM depends on the map resolution (i.e., |U|) (Section 4.1)."

Note that |A| = rCk = O(rk) where r is the number of sampling locations per column and k ≤ r as assumed in Section 2. Though |A| is exponential in the number k of robots, r is expected to be small in a transect, which prevents |A| from growing too large.\nIn contrast, deriving iMASP-based policy π∗ (8) requires O(|A|tt2k4) time. Deriving greedy policies πG (9) and πM (10) incur, respectively, O(|A|t4k3+|A|2tk4) andO(|A|t|U|3+ |A|2tk4) = O(|A|t4r3 + |A|2tk4) time to compute the observation paths over all |A| possible choices of starting robot locations. Clearly, all the non-Markovian strategies do not scale as well as our Markov-based approach with increasing length t+ 1 of planning horizon or number t+ 2 of columns, which is expected to be large.

      "text" : "We will first provide a theoretical guarantee on how the Markov-based policy π̃ (12) performs relative to the nonMarkovian iMASP-based policy π∗ (8) for the case of 1 robot. This key result follows from our intuition that when the horizontal spatial correlation becomes small, exploiting the past measurements for path planning should hardly improve the active sampling performance in a transect sampling task, thus favoring the Markov-based policy. Though this intuition is simple, supporting it with formal theoretical results and their corresponding proofs (Appendix A) turns out to be non-trivial as shown below.\nRecall the Markov assumption that H[Zxi+1 |Zx0:i ] (6) is to be approximated by H[Zxi+1 |Zxi ]. This prompts us to first consider bounding the difference of these posterior entropies that ensues from the Markov property:\nH[Zxi+1 |Zxi ]−H[Zxi+1 |Zx0:i ] = 1\n2 log σ2xi+1|xi σ2xi+1|x0:i\n= 1\n2 log\n( 1− σ2xi+1|xi − σ 2 xi+1|x0:i\nσ2xi+1|xi\n)−1 ≥ 0 . (13)\nThis difference can be interpreted as the reduction in uncertainty of the measurements Zxi+1 to be observed next in stage i + 1 by observing the past measurements Zx0:i−1 from stages 0 to i − 1 given the current measurements Zxi observed in stage i. This difference is small if Zx0:i−1 does not contribute much to the reduction in uncertainty of Zxi+1 given Zxi . It (13) is often known as the conditional mutual information of Zxi+1 and Zx0:i−1 given Zxi denoted by\nI[Zxi+1 ;Zx0:i−1 |Zxi ] 4 = H[Zxi+1 |Zxi ]−H[Zxi+1 |Zx0:i ] ,\nwhich is of value 0 if the Markov property holds. The results to follow assume that the transect is discretized into a grid of sampling locations. Let ω1 and ω2 denote the horizontal and vertical grid discretization widths (i.e., separations between adjacent sampling locations), respectively. Let `′1 4 = `1/ω1 and ` ′ 2 4 = `2/ω2 represent the normalized horizontal and vertical length-scale components, respectively.\nThe following lemma bounds the variance reduction term σ2xi+1|xi − σ 2 xi+1|x0:i in (13):\nLemma 2. Let ξ 4 = exp { − 1\n2`′21\n} and ρ 4 = 1 +\nσ2n σ2s . If\nξ < ρ\ni , then 0 ≤ σ2xi+1|xi − σ 2 xi+1|x0:i ≤\nσ2sξ 4 ρ i − ξ .\nThe next lemma is fundamental to the subsequent results on the active sampling performance of Markov-based policy π̃. It provides bounds on I[Zxi+1 ;Zx0:i−1 |Zxi ], which follow immediately from (13), Lemma 2, and the lower bound\nσ2xi+1|xi = σ 2 xi+1 − (σxi+1xi) 2/σ2xi ≥ σ 2 s + σ 2 n − σ2sξ2 :\nLemma 3. If ξ < ρ\ni , then 0≤ I[Zxi+1 ;Zx0:i−1 |Zxi ]≤∆(i)\nwhere ∆(i) 4 = 1\n2 log\n( 1− ξ 4\n( ρ i − ξ)(ρ− ξ2)\n)−1 .\nRemark. If j ≤ s, then ∆(j) ≤ ∆(s) for j, s = 0, . . . , t.\nFrom Lemma 3, since ∆(i) bounds I[Zxi+1 ;Zx0:i−1 |Zxi ] from above, a small I[Zxi+1 ;Zx0:i−1 |Zxi ] can be guaranteed by making ∆(i) small. From the definition of ∆(i), there are a few ways to achieve a small ∆(i): (a) ∆(i) depends on `′1 through ξ. As ` ′ 1 → 0+, ξ → 0+, by definition. Consequently, ∆(i) → 0+. A small `′1 can be obtained using a small `1 and/or a large ω1, by definition; (b) ∆(i) also depends on the noise-to-signal ratio σ2n/σ 2 s through ρ. Raising σ2n or lowering σ 2 s increases ρ, by definition. This, in turn, decreases ∆(i); (c) Since i indicates the length of history of observations, the remark after Lemma 3 tells us that a shorter length produces a smaller ∆(i). To summarize, (a) environmental field conditions such as smaller horizontal spatial correlation and noisy, less intense fields, and (b) sampling task settings such as larger horizontal grid discretization width and shorter length of history of observations all contribute to smaller ∆(i), and hence smaller I[Zxi+1 ;Zx0:i−1 |Zxi ]. This analysis is important for understanding the practical implication of our theoretical results later. A limitation with using Lemma 3 is that of the sufficient condition ξ < ρ/i, which will hold if the field conditions and task settings realized above to make ∆(i) small are adequately satisfied.\nThe following theorem uses the induced optimal value\nṼ0(x0) from solving the Markov-based path planning problem (11) to bound the maximum entropy V π ∗\n0 (x0) of observation paths achieved by π∗ from solving iMASP (7):\nTheorem 4. Let i 4 = ∑t s=i ∆(s) ≤ (t − i + 1)∆(t). If\nξ < ρ\nt , then Ṽi(xi)− i ≤ V π\n∗ i (x0:i) ≤ Ṽi(xi) for i = 0, . . . , t.\nThe above result is useful in providing an efficient way of knowing the maximum entropy V π ∗ 0 (x0), albeit approximately: the time needed to derive the two-sided bounds on V π ∗\n0 (x0) is linear in the length of planning horizon (Theorem 1) as opposed to exponential time required to compute the exact value of V π ∗ 0 (x0). Since the error bound i is defined as a sum of ∆(s)’s, we can rely on the above analysis of ∆(s) (see paragraph after Lemma 3) to improve this error bound: (a) environmental field conditions such as smaller horizontal spatial correlation and noisy, less intense fields, and (b) sampling task settings such as larger horizontal grid\ndiscretization width and shorter planning horizon (i.e., fewer transect columns) all improve this error bound.\nIn the main result below, the Markov-based policy π̃ is guaranteed to achieve an entropy V π̃0 (x0) of observation paths (i.e., by plugging π̃ into (5)) that is not more than 0 from the maximum entropy V π ∗\n0 (x0) of observation paths achieved by policy π∗:\nTheorem 5. If ξ < ρ\nt , then policy π̃ is 0-optimal in\nachieving the maximum-entropy criterion, i.e., V π ∗\n0 (x0) − V π̃0 (x0) ≤ 0. Again, since the error bound 0 is defined as a sum of ∆(s)’s, we can use the above analysis of ∆(s) to improve this bound: (a) environmental field conditions such as smaller horizontal spatial correlation and noisy, less intense fields, and (b) sampling task settings such as larger horizontal grid discretization width and shorter planning horizon (i.e., fewer transect columns) all result in smaller 0, and hence improve the active sampling performance of Markov-based policy π̃ relative to that of non-Markovian iMASP-based policy π∗. This not only supports our prior intuition (see first paragraph of this section) but also identifies other means of limiting the performance degradation of the Markov-based policy.\nFor the multi-robot case, a condition has to be imposed on the covariance structure of GP to obtain a similar guarantee:\n|σuv|x0:i | ≤ |σuv|xm | (14)\nfor m = 0, . . . , i and any u, v, x0, x1, . . . , xi ∈ U . Intuitively, (14) says that further conditioning does not make Zu and Zv more correlated. Note that (14) is satisfied if u = v.\nSimilar to Lemma 3 for the 1-robot case, we can bound I[Zxi+1 ;Zx0:i−1 |Zxi ] for the multi-robot case but tighter conditions have to be satisfied:\nLemma 6.

Decreasing the number k of robots also reduces ∆k(i), thus yielding tighter bounds on I[Zxi+1 ;Zx0:i−1 |Zxi ].

      "text" : "In Section 4.2, we have highlighted the practical implication of our main theoretical result (i.e., Theorem 5), which establishes various environmental field conditions and sampling task settings to limit the performance degradation of Markov-based policy π̃. This result, however, does not reveal whether π̃ performs well (or not) under “seemingly” less favorable field conditions and task settings that do not jointly satisfy its sufficient condition ξ < ρ/(tk). These include large spatial correlation, less noisy, highly intense fields, small grid discretization width, long planning horizon\n(i.e., many transect columns), and large number of robots. So, this section evaluates the active sampling performance and time efficiency of π̃ empirically on two real-world datasets under such field conditions and task settings as detailed below: (a) May 2009 temperature field data of Panther Hollow Lake in Pittsburgh, PA spanning 25 m by 150 m, and (b) June 2009 plankton density field data of Chesapeake Bay spanning 314 m by 1765 m.\nUsing maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) [8], the learned hyperparameters (i.e., horizontal and vertical length-scales, signal and noise variances) are, respectively, `1 = 40.45 m, `2 = 16.00 m, σ 2 s = 0.1542, and σ 2 n = 0.0036 for the temperature field, and `1 = 27.53 m, `2 = 134.64 m, σ 2 s = 2.152, and σ2n = 0.041 for the plankton density field. It can be observed that the temperature and plankton density fields have low noise-to-signal ratios σ2n/σ 2 s of 0.023 and 0.019, respectively. Relative to the size of transect, both fields have large vertical spatial correlations, but only the temperature field has large horizontal spatial correlation.\nThe performance of Markov-based policy π̃ is compared to non-Markovian policies produced by two state-of-the-art information-theoretic exploration strategies: greedy policies πG (9) and πM (10) proposed by [7] and [3], respectively. The non-Markovian policy π∗ that has to be derived approximately using Learning Real-Time A∗ is excluded from comparison due to the reason provided in Section 1."

      "heading" : "5.1 Performance Metrics",
      "text" : "The tested policies are evaluated using the two metrics proposed in [7], which quantify the mapping uncertainty of the unobserved areas of the field differently: (a) The ENT(π) metric measures the posterior joint entropy H[Zx0:t+1 |Zx0:t+1 ] of field measurements Zx0:t+1 at unobserved locations x0:t+1 where x0:t+1 denotes the vector comprising locations of domain U not found in the sampled locations x0:t+1 selected by policy π. Smaller ENT(π) implies lower mapping uncertainty; (b) The ERR(π) metric measures the mean-squared relative error |U|−1 ∑ u∈U{(zu−µu|x0:t+1)/µ̄}\n2 resulting from using the observations (i.e., sampled locations x0:t+1 and corresponding measurements zx0:t+1) selected by policy π and the posterior mean µu|x0:t+1 (2) to predict the field\nwhere µ̄ = |U|−1 ∑ u∈U zu. Smaller ERR(π) implies higher prediction accuracy. Two noteworthy differences distinguish these metrics: (a) The ENT(π) metric exploits the spatial correlation between field measurements in the unobserved areas whereas the ERR(π) metric implicitly assumes independence between them. As a result, unlike the ERR(π) metric, the ENT(π) metric does not overestimate the mapping uncertainty. To illustrate this, suppose the unknown field measurements are restricted to only two unobserved locations u and v residing in a highly uncertain area and they are highly correlated due to spatial proximity. The behavior of the ENT(π) metric can be understood upon applying the chain rule for entropy (i.e., ENT(π) = H[Zu, Zv|Zx0:t+1 ] = H[Zu|Zx0:t+1 ] + H[Zv|Zx0:t+1 , Zu]); the latter uncertainty term (i.e., posterior entropy of Zv) is significantly reduced or “discounted” due to the high spatial correlation between Zu and Zv. Hence, the mapping uncertainty of these two unobserved locations is not overestimated. A practical advantage of this metric is that it does not overcommit sensing resources; in the simple illustration above, a single observation at either location u or v suffices to learn both field measurements well. On the other hand, the ERR(π) metric considers\neach location to be of high uncertainty due to the independence assumption; (b) In contrast to the ENT(π) metric, the ERR(π) metric can use ground truth measurements to evaluate if the field is being mapped accurately. Let ENTD(π) 4 = ENT(π̃)−ENT(π) and ERRD(π) 4= ERR(π̃)−ERR(π). Decreasing ENTD(π) improves the ENT(π̃) performance of π̃ relative to that of π. Small |ENTD(π)| implies that π̃ achieves ENT(π̃) performance comparable to that of π. ERRD(π) can be interpreted likewise. Additionally, we will consider the time taken to derive each policy as the third metric."

The temperature field is discretized into a 5×30 grid of sampling locations as shown in Figs. 1 and 2d. The horizontal and/or vertical length-scales of the original field (i.e., field 4 in Fig. 2d) are reduced to produce modified fields 1, 2, and 3 (respectively, Figs. 2a, 2b, and 2c); we fix these reduced length-scales while learning the remaining hyperparameters (i.e., signal and noise variances) through MLE.\nTable 1 shows the results of mean ENT(π) and ERR(π) performance of tested policies (i.e., averaged over all possible starting robot locations) with varying length-scales and number of robots. The ENT(π) and ERR(π) for all policies generally decrease with increasing length-scales (except ERR(π̃) for 1 robot from field 2 to 4) due to increasing spatial correlation between measurements, thus resulting in lower mapping uncertainty.\nFor the case of 1 robot, the observations are as follows: (a) When `2 is kept constant (i.e., at 5 m or 16 m), reducing `1 from 40.45 m to 5 m (i.e., from field 3 to 1 or field 4 to 2) decreases ENTD(πG), ERRD(πG), ENTD(πM ), and ERRD(πM ): when the horizontal correlation becomes small, it can no longer be exploited by the non-Markovian policies πG and πM ; (b) For field 3 with large `1 and small `2,\nTable 1: Comparison of ENT(π) (left) and ERR(π) (×10−5) (right) performance for temperature fields that are discretized into 5× 30 grids (Fig. 2).\n1 robot Field\nPolicy 1 2 3 4\nπ̃ -83 -246 -543 -597\nπG -82 -246 -554 -598 πM -80 -211 -554 -596\n1 robot Field\nPolicy 1 2 3 4\nπ̃ 3.7040 0.5713 2.3680 0.5754\nπG 1.8680 0.5713 0.0801 0.0252 πM 1.8433 0.5212 0.0701 0.0421\n2 robots Field\nPolicy 1 2 3 4\nπ̃ -71 -190 -380 -422\nπG -72 -190 -382 -425 πM -68 -131 -382 -421\n2 robots Field\nPolicy 1 2 3 4\nπ̃ 0.3797 0.2101 0.1171 0.0095\nπG 0.3526 0.2101 0.0150 0.0087 πM 0.6714 0.1632 0.0148 0.0086\n3 robots Field\nPolicy 1 2 3 4\nπ̃ -53 -109 -232 -297\nπG -53 -109 -215 -297 πM -53 -73 -214 -255\n3 robots Field\nPolicy 1 2 3 4\nπ̃ 0.1328 0.0068 0.0063 0.0031\nπG 0.1312 0.0068 0.0059 0.0031 πM 0.1080 0.1397 0.0055 0.0030\nENTD(πG) and ENTD(πM ) are large as the Markov property of π̃ prevents it from exploiting the large horizontal correlation; (c) When `1 is kept constant (i.e., at 5 m or 40.45 m), reducing `2 from 16 m to 5 m (i.e., from field 2 to 1 or field 4 to 3) increases ERRD(πG) and ERRD(πM ): when vertical correlation becomes small, it can no longer be exploited by π̃, thus incurring larger ERR(π̃).\nFor the case of 2 robots, the observations are as follows: (a) |ENTD(πG)| and |ENTD(πM )| are small for all fields except for field 2 where π̃ significantly outperforms πM . In particular, when `2 is kept constant (i.e., at 5 m or 16 m), reducing `1 from 40.45 m to 5 m (i.e., from field 3 to 1 or field 4 to 2) decreases ENTD(πG), ENTD(πM ), and ERRD(πG): this is explained in the first observation of 1-robot case; (b) For field 3 with large `1 and small `2, ERRD(π\nG) and ERRD(πM ) are large: this is explained in the second and third observations of 1-robot case; (c) When `1 is kept constant (i.e., at 5 m or 40.45 m), reducing `2 from 16 m to 5 m (i.e., from field 2 to 1 or field 4 to 3) increases ERRD(πG): this is explained in the third observation of 1-robot case. This also holds for ERRD(πM ) when `1 is large.\nFor the case of 3 robots, it can be observed that π̃ can achieve ENT(π̃) and ERR(π̃) performance comparable to (if not, better than) that of πG and πM for all fields.\nTo summarize the above observations on spatial correlation conditions favoring π̃ over πG and πM , π̃ can achieve ENT(π̃) performance comparable to (if not, better than) that of πG and πM for all fields with any number of robots except for field 3 (i.e., of large `1 and small `2) with 1 robot as explained previously. Policy π̃ can achieve comparable ERR(π̃) performance for field 2 (i.e., of small `1 and large `2) with 1 robot because π̃ is capable of exploiting the large vertical correlation, and the small horizontal correlation cannot be exploited by πG and πM . Policy π̃ can also achieve comparable ERR(π̃) performance for all fields with 2 and 3 robots except for field 3 (i.e., of large `1 and small `2) with 2 robots. These observations reveal that (a) small horizontal and large vertical correlations are favorable to π̃; (b) though large horizontal and small vertical correlations are not favorable to π̃, this problem can be mitigated by increasing the number of robots.

      "heading" : "6. CONCLUSION",
      "text" : "This paper describes an efficient Markov-based informationtheoretic path planner for active sampling of GP-based environmental fields. We have provided theoretical guarantees on the active sampling performance of our Markov-based policy π̃ for the transect sampling task, from which ideal environmental field conditions (i.e., small horizontal spatial correlation and noisy, less intense fields) and sampling task settings (i.e., large grid discretization width and short planning horizon) can be established to limit its performance degradation. Empirically, we have shown that π̃ can generally achieve active sampling performance comparable to that of the widely-used non-Markovian greedy policies πG and πM under less favorable realistic field conditions (i.e., low noise-to-signal ratio) and task settings (i.e., small grid discretization width and long planning horizon) while enjoying huge computational gain over them. In particular, we have empirically observed that (a) small horizontal and large vertical correlations strongly favor π̃; (b) though large horizontal and small vertical correlations do not favor π̃, this problem can be mitigated by increasing the number of robots. In fact, deploying a large robot team often produces superior active sampling performance of π̃ over πM in our experiments, not forgetting the computational gain of > 4 orders of magnitude. Our Markov-based planner can be used to efficiently achieve more general exploration tasks (e.g., boundary tracking and those in [6, 7]), but the guarantees provided here may not apply. For our future work, we will “relax” the Markov assumption by utilizing a longer (but not entire) history of observations in path planning. This can potentially improve the active sampling performance in\nfields of moderate to large horizontal correlation but does not incur as much time as that of non-Markovian policies."

Doing this over all possible vectors of current robot locations in each column thus incurs |A|×O(|A|k4) = O(|A|2k4) time since the vector space of current robot locations in each column is of the same size as that of the joint action space |A|. We do not have to compute these posterior entropies again for every column because the entropies evaluated for any one column replicate across different columns. This computational saving is due to the Markov assumption and the problem structure of the transect sampling task. Propagating the optimal values from stages t to 0 takes O(|A|2t) time. Hence, solving the Markov-based path planning problem (11) or deriving the Markov-based policy π̃ (12) takes O(|A|2(t + k4)) time for the transect sampling task."
