      "text" : "The design and analysis of interactions of self-interested parties are central to the theory and application of multi-agent systems. In particular, the theory of economic mechanism design or, more generally, implementation theory (Maskin, 1999; Maskin & Sjostrom, 2002) has become a standard tool for researchers in the areas of multi-agent systems and e-commerce (Rosenschein & Zlotkin, 1994; Nisan & Ronen, 1999; Shoham & Tennenholtz, 2001; Feigenbuam & S, 2002; Tennenholtz, 1999; Papadimitriou, 2001). In classical mechanism design1 a center defines an interaction for self-motivated parties that will allow it to obtain some desired goal (such as maximizing revenue or social welfare) taking the agents’ incentives\n1. See e.g., Fudenberg and Tirole (1991), Chapter 7, or Mas-Colell, Whinston, and Green (1995), Chapter 23.\nc©2004 AI Access Foundation. All rights reserved.\ninto account. This perspective has been largely motivated by the view of the center as a government or a seller that can define and control the rules of interaction. However, in many distributed systems and multi-agent interactions, interested parties cannot control the rules of interactions. A network manager for example cannot simply change the communication protocols in a given distributed systems in order to lead to desired behaviors, and a broker cannot change the rules in which goods are sold by an agency auctioneer to the public. The focus of this paper is on how a reliable interested party, which cannot change the rules of interaction, and cannot enforce behavior, can obtain its desired goals (in service of the community or for its own benefits). The reliable party has only one source of power: its reliability. It can commit to payments to the different agents, when certain observable outcomes will be reached, and the agents can be sure that they will be paid appropriately.\nIn our work we introduce the study of implementation of desired behaviors by interested party as above.2 There are two major issues that make the task non-trivial and challenging:\n1. The interested party may wish to assume as little as possible about agents’ rationality. Ideally, all that will be assumed is that an agent does not adopt a strategy if it is dominated by another strategy.\n2. The interested party may wish to minimize its expenses.\nConsider the following simple congestion setting.3 Assume that there are two agents, 1 and 2, that have to select among two service providers (e.g., machines, communication lines, etc.) One of the service providers, f , is a fast one, while the other, s, is a slower one. We capture this by having an agent obtaining a payoff of 6 when he is the only one that uses f , and a payoff of 4 when he is the only one who uses s. If both agents select the same service provider then its speed of operation decreases by a factor of 2, leading to half the payoff. That is, if both agents use f then each one of them obtains a payoff of 3, while if both agents use s then each one of them obtains 2. In a matrix form, this game is described by the following bimatrix:\nM =\ns\nf\nf s\n3\n3\n4\n6\n6\n4\n2\n2\n2. For another interesting use of an interested party see Naor, Pinkas, and Sumner (1999). 3. Congestion in the context of self-motivated parties is a central topic in the recent CS literature (Kout-\nsoupias & Papadimitriou, 1999; Roughgarden, 2001; Roughgarden & Tardos, 2002), as well as in the game theory literature (Rosenthal, 1973; Monderer & Shapley, 1996). This example is used for purposes of illustration only; however, the technique used in this example can be extended to arbitrary complex games, as we will later show.\nAssume that our reliable interested party may wish to prevent the agents from using the same service provider (leading to low payoffs for both). Then it can do as follows: it can promise to pay agent 1 a value of 10 if both agents will use f , and promise to pay agent 2 a value of 10 if both agents will use s. These promises transform M to the following game:\nM ′ =\ns\nf\nf s\n13\n3\n4\n6\n6\n4\n2\n12\nNotice that in M ′, strategy f is dominant for agent 1, and strategy s is dominant for agent 2. As a result the only rational strategy profile is the one in which agent 1 chooses f and agent 2 chooses s. Hence, the interested party implements one of the desired outcomes. Moreover, given that the strategy profile (f, s) is selected the interested party will have to pay nothing. It has just implemented (in dominant strategies) a desired behavior (obtained in one of the Nash equilibria) with zero cost, relying only on its creditability, without modifying the rules of interactions or enforcing any type of behavior.\nSimilar simple examples can be found in other contexts (see e.g., Segal (1999), footnote 30, and Dybvig and Spatt (1983), Spiegler (2000)). Our work advocates the following line of thought. Instead of reasoning about how agents will behave in the given protocol, we may wish to cause agents to follow particular behaviors by making them desirable, using monetary offers. An important point is that the monetary offers need not necessarily be fully materialized when agents follow the desired behavior.\nMore formally, in this paper we introduce the notion and study of k-implementation of a desired set of strategy profiles, where k stands for the amount of payment that need to be actually made in order to implement the desirable outcomes.4 Section 3 provides a characterization of k-implementation of a single pure strategy profile for finite games and infinite regular games with complete information. This provides an effective algorithm for determining the optimal monetary offers to be made in order to implement a desired outcome, while minimizing expenses. In Section 4 we address the problem of finding a kimplementation of a set of strategy profiles. We show that the general problem in this regard\n4. Notice that this perspective is in the spirit of work on Artificial Social Systems in AI (see e.g., Shoham and Tennenholtz (1995)), where we search for some form of ”modification” to the system, such that given the modified system, and assuming agents tend to work individually, a desirable outcome will be obtained.\nis NP-hard, and consider a modification of k-implementation, titled exact implementation, under which the problem becomes tractable.5\nGames with incomplete information introduce further challenges. In particular, in Section 5 we consider the VCG mechanisms for combinatorial auctions 6. This setting has interesting characteristics since the interested party cannot in general see the agents’ types and needs to decide on appropriate payment only based on observed behaviors. We show that in general 0-implementation (i.e. implementation with zero cost) in settings with incomplete information is impossible, but any ex-post equilibrium of a frugal VCG mechanism is 0-implementable.\nIn Section 6 we study the important case of mixed strategies. In that context, unless we assume algorithmic observability, the interested party can observe only the actions selected and not the probabilistic process leading to the selection, and therefore our earlier results do not apply. For example, consider the simple routing problem above, one may wish to consider the implementation of a more ”fair” outcome, such as the one obtained in the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium of the game M . In order to address this issue, we introduce the concept of implementation devices, and show that any mixed strategy equilibrium is 0-implementable with an implementation device. We also show that any correlated equilibrium has this property."

Complexity of implementation when the organizer controls the structure of the game is discussed by Conitzer and Sandholm (2002). 6. The VCG mechanisms (Vickrey, 1961; Clarke, 1971; Groves, 1973) have been widely discussed in the context of combinatorial auctions, a topic which received much attention in the recent multi-agent systems and e-commerce literature, e.g., (Nisan, 2000; Sandholm, Suri, Gilpin, & Levine, 2001; Parkes, 1999) 7. If the game is finite the payoff functions are automatically bounded.\nto x−i. That is,\nUi(xi, x−i) ≥ Ui(yi, x−i) for every i ∈ N and yi ∈ Xi.\nThat is, if every player i believes that all other players act according to x, he is better off by playing according to x. Modern economic theory has made an (some times implicit) assumption that economic interactions are in equilibrium. However, the rationale for this assumption is in debate in many cases, and it is particulary so when there exist multiple equilibrium profiles. In contrast, using a non-dominated strategy is a rational behavior in any reasonable definition of rationality. Moreover, refraining from the use of dominated strategies is taken as the most basic idea and agreed upon technique in decision theory.\nLet G = (N,X) be a pre-game. For every vector of payoff functions V , let X̄i(V ) be the set of non-dominated strategies of i in the game G(V ), and let X̄(V ) = X̄1(V ) × X̄2(V )×, · · · , X̄n(V ). Ḡ(V ) is the game (N, X̄, V ), where, by an innocent abuse of notations V denotes the vector of the payoff functions restricted to X̄. A vector V of payoff functions is non-negative (V ≥ 0) if Vi(x) ≥ 0 for every player i and for every x ∈ X.\nConsider a set of desired strategy profiles O ⊆ X in the game G(U). A non-negative vector of payoff functions V implements O in G(U) if\n• ∅ ⊂ X̄(U + V ) ⊆ O.\nSuch a V is called a k-implementation of O in G(U), if in addition\n• ∑n\ni=1 Vi(x) ≤ k for every x ∈ X̄(U + V ).\nObviously, by paying every player i sufficient amount of money for playing the strategy associated with a particular strategy profile in O, one can implement O.\nThat is, the interested party commits herself to certain non-negative payoffs V , in such a way that ”rational” players will only choose strategy profiles in O, and such that in the worst case the interested party will have to pay at most k.\nNote that implicitly we have made two important assumptions :\n• Output observability: The interested party can observe the actions chosen by the players.\n• Commitment power: The interested party is reliable in the sense that the players believe that she will indeed pay the additional payoff defined by V .\nHowever, the requirement V ≥ 0 means that the interested party cannot force players to make payments based on their actions. In addition, the interested party cannot modify the set of available strategies, or enforce behavior in any way. He can just reliably promise positive monetary transfers conditioned on the observed outcome.\nLet k(O) be the price of implementing O. That is, k(O) is the greatest lower bound (GLB) of all non-negative numbers q for which there exists a q- implementation. That is,\nk(O) = k implies that for every ǫ > 0 O has a (k + ǫ)- implementation vector V ǫ, and O does not have a k′- implementation for any k′ < k.

Every strategy profile z has an optimal implementation V , and moreover:\nk(z) =\nn∑\ni=1\nmax xi∈Xi (Ui(xi, z−i) − Ui(zi, z−i)) . 3.1.1\nProof: Let z ∈ X and let V implements z. Let i ∈ N . If for some xi 6= zi, for some x−i, Vi(xi, x−i) > 0, then one can modify Vi by changing this term to 0, and get a cheaper implementation of z. Hence, we can assume without loss of generality that we deal with payoff function vectors V for which, for every i, Vi(xi, ∗) = 0 for every xi 6= zi.\nAs zi is a dominant strategy for i in G(U + V ),\nVi(zi, x−i)+Ui(zi, x−i) ≥ Vi(xi, x−i)+Ui(xi, x−i) for every xi ∈ Xi, and for every x−i ∈ X−i.\nSince for xi 6= zi, Vi(xi, ∗) = 0, a necessary condition for an implementation is\nVi(zi, x−i) + Ui(zi, x−i) ≥ Ui(xi, x−i) for every xi ∈ Xi.\nThat is,\nVi(zi, x−i) ≥ max xi∈Xi (Ui(xi, x−i) − Ui(zi, x−i)).\nOne can use x−i 6= z−i in order to get a costless strict inequality required by the definition of domination ( here we use our assumption that every player has at least two strategies). Hence, an optimal implementation vector for z, V is defined for every i by: Vi(xi, ∗) = 0 for xi 6= zi, and Vi(zi, x−i) = maxxi∈Xi(Ui(xi, z−i) − Ui(zi, z−i)) + δ(x−i), where δ : X−i → ℜ is a nonnegative function that satisfies δ(z−i) = 0, and for some x−i 6= z−i, δ(x−i) > 0. Therefore (3.1.1) is satisfied. ¤\nNote that z is in equilibrium if and only if for every player i, maxxi∈Xi(Ui(xi, z−i) − Ui(zi, z−i)) = 0. Hence the following characterization of equilibrium is a corollary of Theorem 1:\nCorollary 1 Let G(U) be a finite game with at least two strategies to every player, and let z ∈ X. z is in equilibrium if and only if z has a zero- implementation."

      "text" : "When the game G(U) is infinite, one can get phenomena that contradicts our intuition. For example, it is possible that X̄i = {zi} but zi is not a dominant strategy. E.g., consider the two-person game in which player 1 can choose the strategy z1, or any number 0 < x1 < 1, and player 2 can choose z2 or x2. U1(z1, z2) = 0.5, U1(z1, x2) = 10, U1(x1, ∗) = x1. U2 is an arbitrary function. It is easily seen that every x1 is dominated by a bigger number in the open interval (0,1), z1 is not dominated, and hence X̄1 = {z1}. However, z1 does not dominate x1 for x1 > 0.5. Moreover, the max operator used in the proofs of Theorem 1 and 2 may not be well-defined for infinite games. A game G(U) = (N,X,U) is called regular if every Xi is a compact metric space, and the payoff functions are continuous on X endowed with the product metric.\nTheorem 2 Theorems 1 holds for regular games.\nProof: The proof requires very standard techniques, and therefore it is omitted.¤\nWe then immediately get:\nCorollary 2 Corollary 1 holds for regular games."

      "heading" : "3.3 Mixed strategies",
      "text" : "For every finite set B we denote by ∆(B) the set of probability distributions over B. That is, ∆(B) consists of all functions q : B → [0, 1] with ∑ b∈B q(b) = 1. Let G(U) = (N,X,U) be a finite game. The mixed extension of G(U) is the infinite game Gm(Um) = (N,Xm, Um), where Xm = ∆(X1) × ∆(X2) × · · · × ∆(Xn), and for every player i, U\nm i (p1, p2, · · · , pn) =∑\nx∈X p1(x1)p2(x2) · · · pn(xn)Ui(x). That is, U m i (p) is the expected payoff of player i when every player j (including i) is choosing his strategy ( independently of the other players) with a randomizing device that chooses each strategy xj with probability pj(xj).\nA profile of mixed strategies p ∈ Xm is called a mixed-strategy equilibrium in G(U) if p is in equilibrium in the game Gm(Um). By Nash (1950) every finite game possesses a\nmixed strategy equilibrium. Note that every strategy xi ∈ Xi of i can be identified with the mixed strategy in which i chooses xi with probability 1. In this sense, Xi is a subset of Xmi . When we deal with an environment in which mixed strategies are considered, we refer to every strategy xi ∈ Xi as a pure strategy of i.\nNote that the possibility of using mixed strategies does not destroy our previous results. That is, if xi is a dominant (dominated) strategy in G(U), it continues to be a dominant (dominated) strategy in Gm(Um).\nAs Gm(Um) is a regular game we can apply Theorem 2 Corollary 2 and deduce:\nTheorem 3 Let G(U) be a finite game in strategic form with at least two strategies for every player. Let p be a profile of mixed strategies in G(U). p is a mixed strategy equilibrium in G(U) if and only if p has a 0-implementation in Gm(Um).\nHence, technically, the case of mixed strategies follows from the theorems regarding pure strategies in infinite games. However, the reader should notice that in this case our output observability assumption has a strong implication. Implementing a mixed strategy profile in Gm(Um) actually means algorithm observability in G(U). That is, the interested party can observe the mixed strategies used by the players. This is a realistic assumption if we think about the interested party as a system’s administrator that deploys algorithms submitted by users. The designer is not allowed to alter the users’ algorithms, but can verify the exact content of these algorithms. Hence, for example, in such a setting, if a user’s algorithm flips a coin in order to decide on its course of action, then the exact randomized algorithms, including the particular coin flipping, can be viewed by the interested party. The interesting case in which the interested party cannot observe the mixed strategies will be discussed in Section 6.\n4. k-implementation of sets\nIn the previous sections we dealt with some properties of k- implementation. In particular we emphasized the interesting cases of k-implementations of singletons. However, from a computational perspective, given a game G(U), and a set of desired strategy profile O, it may be of interest to find the smallest integer k ≥ 0 for which a k- implementation exists. We can show:\nTheorem 4 Given a game G(U), a set of desired strategy profiles O, and an integer k ≥ 0, deciding whether there exists a k implementation of O in G(U) is NP-hard.\nProof: In order to prove the above theorem, we use a reduction from the SAT problem. Given a set of primitive propositions {x1, x2, . . . , xn}, consider a CNF formula. A CNF formula is a conjunction of clauses C1 ∧C2 ∧ . . .∧Cm, where Ci = l1i ∨ li2 ∨ . . .∨ lisi (si ≥ 2) and where ljq = xi or ljq = ¬xi for some i (for every 1 ≤ j ≤ m and 1 ≤ q ≤ sj). The SAT problem is the following decision problem: given a CNF formula, is there a truth assignment to the primitive propositions that satisfies it? This problem is known to be NP-complete.\nWe will now show a polynomial reduction from SAT to the problem of deciding whether a 2- implementation exists, where the games are 2-person games. This will suffice to prove our result. Without loss of generality we restrict our attention to CNF formulas where both xi and ¬xi appear in the formula, and no clause refers to both xi and ¬xi (1 ≤ i ≤ n).\nBoth agents will have a strategy ci associated with clause Ci, for every 1 ≤ i ≤ m. In addition, both agents will have strategies yi, zi, associated with the literals xi and ¬xi, respectively (1 ≤ i ≤ n).\nThe payoff of agent 1, p1, will be defined as follows. For any strategy profile of the form (ci, yj) the payoff will be 3 if xj appears in clause i and 0 otherwise. For any strategy profile of the form (ci, zj) the payoff will be 3 if ¬xj appears in clause i and 0 otherwise. For any strategy profile of the form (ci, cj) the payoff will be 50 if i = j and 0 otherwise. For any strategy profile of the form (yi, yj) the payoff will be 2 if i = j and 3 otherwise. For any strategy profile of the form (zi, zj) the payoff will be 2 if i = j and 3 otherwise. For any strategy profile of the form (yi, zj) or the form (zi, yj) the payoff will be 1 if i = j and 3 otherwise. For any strategy profile of the form (yi, cj) the payoff will be 51 if xi or ¬xi appear in clause Cj and 0 otherwise. For any strategy profile of the form (zi, cj) the payoff will be 51 if xi or ¬xi appears in clause Cj and 0 otherwise.\nThe payoff to agent 2, p2, will be as follows. The payoff for any strategy profile of the form (yi, yi) or (zi, zi) will be 101; the payoff for any strategy profile of the form (yi, zi) or (zi, yi) will be 100; the payoff for any strategy profile of the form (yi, zj) or (zi, yj) where i 6= j will be 0. The payoff for any strategy profile of the form (ci, cj) will be 50 if i = j, and 0 otherwise. For any strategy profile of the form (yi, cj), (zi, cj) the payoff will be 50 if i = j and 0 otherwise. The payoff for any strategy profile of the form (ci, yj), (ci, zj) will be 0.\nThe set O of desired strategy profiles will include all strategy profiles excluding the following: All strategy profiles of the form (ci, s),(yi, zi),(zi, yi) (where s is any strategy) will be prohibited.\nIf the formula is satisfiable then there is 2- implementation: add 1 to the payoff obtained by agent 1 in any strategy profile of the form (yi, s) if xi is true in the satisfying assignment, and add 1 to the payoff obtained by agent 1 in any strategy profile of the form (zi, s) if xi it false. As for agent 2, increase its payoff by 1 for (zi, yi) if xi is true, and increase its payoff by 1 for (yi, zi) if xi is false.\nNotice that given the above construction the strategies of the form ci of agent 1 will become dominated and will be removed. In addition, if xi has been assigned true (resp. false) then strategy zi (resp. yi) will become dominated. The corresponding strategies of agent 2 (i.e. zi if xi is true and yi if xi is false) will become dominated too, which yield the desired behavior.\nSimilarly, notice that since we must remain with at least one yi or zi for agent 1, it must be the case that at least one yi or zi will be removed for agent 2, and that this cannot be obtained with a payment of 1 (increasing the payoff from 100 to 101). Hence, in a 2- implementation the payment of agent 2 should be 1. However, notice that we must add 1 to the payoff of agent 1 for at least one of the elements of the form (yi, yi) or (zi, zi) which\ncorrespond to an xi or ¬xi that appear in clause j (i.e. for at least one of the literals in clause j, we need to add 1 to a strategy profile of the form (yi, yi) or (zi, zi) associated with that literal). Notice that this is based on the fact that the strategy ci of agent i cannot be removed by adding a payment of 1 to the outcome of any strategy of the form yj , zj , cj of agent 1, where xj and ¬xj do not appear in Ci, since the payoff of agent 1 for (yj , ci) and for (zj , ci) is 0, while the payoff of agent 1 for (ci, ci) is 50. Moreover, if we add 1 to the payoff that agent 1 obtains for both (yi, yi) and (zi, zi) then both yi and zi will not be dominated for agent 1, which will result in the possibility of playing a strategy profile which is not desired(given that it is impossible to remove both yi and zi for agent 2). Hence, the implementation corresponds to a sound truth assignment to the CNF formula, where xi is assigned true iff the payoff for agent 1 at (yi, yi) has been augmented by 1.\nNotice that the previous result applies already in the case where we have a constant number of agents. The previous result suggests one may wish to consider relaxations of the optimal implementation problem that will be tractable.8 One interesting relaxation9 is the following one:\nA non-negative vector of payoff functions V is called a k- exact implementation of O in G(U), if the following two conditions are satisfied:\n• X̄(U + V ) = O. • ∑n\ni=1 Vi(x) ≤ k for every x ∈ O.\nHence, V implements O means that the set of non-dominated strategies in G(U + V ) is a subset of O, while V is an exact implementation of O if this set equals O. When dealing with singletons the concepts of implementation and exact implementation coincide.\nNotice that the concept of exact implementation makes sense only when O = O1 × O2 · · · × On ⊆ X = X1 × X2 · · · × Xn since otherwise it will be impossible to (exactly) implement O. We also assume that Oi is strictly contained in Xi for every agent i, and that Oi does not contain two strategies such that one dominates the other. We can show:\nTheorem 5 Computing the optimal k for which an exact implementation exists is polynomial.\nThe algorithm leading to the above result is now illustrated for the case of two agents. We construct the game matrix G′, where the payoff function of agent i is denoted by pi; pi describes the payment to agent i for the different strategy profiles (if/when selected). The matrix G′ will be the matrix of perturbations (non-negative monetary promises), while Ḡ will denote the perturbed matrix generated. Let M = K + 1 where K is the maximal element in the original game matrix.\nThe optimal perturbation [OP] algorithm:\n8. Another approach may be to search for good approximation techniques. 9. See the discussion in the last section.\n1.

However, a typical example is shown in Figure 1.\nIn this game, Player 1 is about to receive one of the signals s1 or t1, and Player 2 is about to receive one of the signals10, s2 or t2. The true game to be played is determined by the pair (c1, d2), where c, d ∈ {s, t}. However, neither player knows the exact game. Given s1 (s2) player 1 (player 2) has to choose an action in {U1, D1} ({L1, R1}), and given t1 (t2) player 1 (player 2) has to choose an action in {U2, D2} ({L2, R2}). The payoffs are shown in the figure. A Bayesian game is obtained from a game in informational form by adding a probability distribution over the pairs of signals as described in Figure 2. The probability that 1 receives the signal c1, and 2 receives d2 equals pij , where i = 1 if c = s, i = 2 if c = t, j = 1 if d = s, j = 2 if d = t.\nA strategy of a player is a function defined on the set of signals, which assigns to every signal an action11 in the games that are consistent with this signal.

A strategy of player 2 is analogously defined as a function b2 : {s2, t2} → {L1, R1, L2, R2}. The concepts of domination and of equilibrium ( traditionally referred to as ex post equilibrium) are naturally defined. For example, in Figure 3 The strategy of player 1 in which she chooses U1 when she receives the signal s1, and she chooses D2 given t1 dominates each of the other four strategies of player 1.\nThat is, given s1, independently of the other player’s signal and action, choosing U1 is at least as good as choosing D1, and for at least one signal and action of Player 2, choosing U1 is strictly better than choosing D1.\nFigure 4 demonstrate an ex post equilibrium.\n11. In an environment in which complex strategies exist, we refer to the choices of a player at a game in strategic form as actions.\nNote that even under the output observability assumption a player does not have to reveal her strategy. The signal of a player is her private knowledge, and she reveals only the action she chooses. The interested party does not observe the signals; therefore, if the action sets in all games are the same ( as is the case in Figure 4) the interested party does not receive any information about the true game to be played. Hence, the only thing he can do is to use the same vector V at all games. Therefore:\nClaim For every k ≥ 0 It is impossible to k-implement the ex post equilibrium described in Figure 4.\nProof The interested party wishes to make U a dominant strategy at the game (s1, t2), and she wishes to make D a dominant strategy at (t1, t2). Assume V1(U,L) = x and V1(D,L) = y, then the following two contradictory inequalities should be satisfied: 0 + x ≥ 7 + y, and 5 + x ≤ 4 + y.¤\nAs is stated in the next subsection, when the game in informational form has a particular structure, our results for the complete information case are generalized."

      "text" : "Combinatorial auctions constitute a special class of games in informational form. Our notations and definitions are taken from Holzman and Monderer (2002).\nIn a combinatorial auction there is a seller, denoted by 0, who wishes to sell a set of m goods A = {a1, . . . , am}, m ≥ 1, that she owns. We denote by 2\nA the family of all bundles of goods (i.e., subsets of A). There is a set of n buyers N = {1, . . . , n}, n ≥ 1. An allocation of the goods is an ordered partition γ = (γ0, γ1, . . . , γn) of A.\n12 We denote by Γ the set of all allocations.\n12. Note that the goods are allocated among the buyers and the seller. We assume, however, that the seller derives no utility from keeping any of the goods, and that she does not set strategic reserve prices.\nA buyer’s valuation function is a function v : 2A → ℜ, satisfying v(∅) = 0 and\nB ⊆ C, B,C ∈ 2A ⇒ v(B) ≤ v(C).\nWhen buyer i with the valuation function vi receives the set of goods B, and pays a monetary transfer ci ∈ ℜ his utility is vi(B) − ci. Every buyer knows his valuation function.\nWe denote by V the set of all possible valuation functions. The set V N , the n-fold product of the set V , is the set of all profiles of valuations v = (v1, . . . ,vn), one for each buyer.\nFor an allocation γ = (γ0, γ1, . . . , γn) ∈ Γ and a profile of valuations v = (v1, . . . ,vn) ∈ VN we denote by S(v, γ) the total social surplus of the buyers, that is,\nS(v, γ) = ∑\ni∈N\nvi(γi).\nWe also denote Smax(v) = max\nγ∈Γ S(v, γ),\nand we refer to an allocation γ that achieves this maximum as an optimal allocation for v.\nA Vickrey-Clarke (VC) auction mechanism is described as follows. Every buyer i is required to report a valuation function v̂i. Based on the reported valuations v̂ = (v̂1, . . . , v̂n) ∈ V N the mechanism selects an allocation d(v̂) = (d0(v̂), . . . , dn(v̂)) ∈ Γ, which is optimal for v̂. Because ties are possible, such an allocation may not be unique, and therefore there is more than one VC mechanism. Every function d : V N → Γ satisfying S(v̂,d(v̂)) = Smax(v̂) for all v̂ ∈ VN determines uniquely a VC mechanism, which we refer to as the VC mechanism d. This mechanism assigns to buyer i the bundle di(v̂) and makes him pay c d i (v̂) to the seller, where\ncdi (v̂) = max γ∈Γ\n∑\nj 6=i\nv̂j(γj) − ∑\nj 6=i\nv̂j(dj(v̂)).\nThis represents the loss to the other agents’ total surplus caused by agent i’s presence.\nA Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction mechanism is parameterized by a VC mechanism d, and by an n-tuple h = (h1, . . . ,hn) of functions hi : V\nN\\{i} → ℜ. The mechanism selects an allocation according to the allocation function d, and the transfer function of buyer i is\nc d,h i (v̂) = c d i (v̂) + hi(v̂−i).\nHence, a VC auction mechanism is a special type of VCG auction mechanism, in which hi is the function that is identically equal to zero for every i.\nLet AM = (d, h) be a VCG mechanism. The utility of i with the valuation vi depends on the vector of reported valuations v̂ = (vi, v̂−i), and it is denoted by ui(vi, v̂i, v̂−i). That is,\nui(vi, v̂i, v̂−i) = vi(di(v̂)) − c d,h i (v̂).\nThe behavior of buyer i in a mechanism AM is described by a strategy bi : V → V .\nA strategy bi is a dominant strategy for i if the following two conditions hold: 13\n• For every vi ∈ V , and for every v̂−i ∈ V N\\{i}\nui(vi, bi(vi), v̂−i) ≥ ui(vi, v̂i, v̂−i) for every v̂i ∈ V .\n• For every vi ∈ V , there exists v̂−i ∈ V N\\{i} such that\nui(vi, bi(vi), v̂−i) > ui(vi, v̂i, v̂−i).\nA strategy profile (b1, . . . , bn) forms an ex post equilibrium if for every profile of valuations v = (v1, . . . ,vn) ∈ V N, and for every buyer i,\nui(vi, bi(vi),b−i(v−i)) ≥ ui(vi, v̂i,b−i(v−i)) for every v̂i ∈ V ,\nwhere b−i(v−i) = (bj(vj))j6=i. The profile (b1, . . . , bn) is symmetric if bi = bj for every two buyers i, j ∈ N .\nIt is well-known that every VCG auction mechanism is truth-telling in the sense that for every buyer i, the strategy bi(vi) = vi of revealing the true valuation is a dominant strategy.14\nSpecial type of strategies were considered by Holzman et al. (2003), Holzman and Monderer (2002). A bundling strategy for buyer i is parameterized by a subfamily Σi of 2\nA such that ∅ ∈ Σi, and is denoted by f Σi . It maps every v ∈ V to vΣi ∈ V defined by\nvΣi(B) = max C⊆B,C∈Σi v(C) for every B ∈ 2A.\nThis has the effect of pretending that the agent cares only about bundles in Σi (for which he announces his true valuation), and derives his valuation for other bundles by maximizing over the bundles in Σi that they contain.\nA valuation vΣi that satisfies the above equalities is said to be based on Σi ( or, simply Σi-based). The set of all Σ-based valuation function is denoted by V Σ.\nA subfamily Σ of 2A such that ∅ ∈ Σ is a quasi field if it satisfies the following two conditions:\nB ∈ Σ ⇒ A \\B ∈ Σ,\nB,C ∈ Σ and B ∩ C = ∅ ⇒ B ∪ C ∈ Σ.\nIn the work by Holzman and Monderer (2002) it was proven that every ex post equilibrium in the VCG mechanisms is a bundling equilibrium in the following sense: For every\n13. In classical mechanism design the second condition is not required. We use it here for the sake of consistency with the rest of this paper. 14. This is one of the reasons to the fact that the concept of ex post equilibrium in the VCG auction mechanisms with private values has largely been ignored in the economics literature. However, the truth telling strategy is induces a high communication complexity; It requires each player to communicate 2m\nnumbers. Hence, from the computer science perspective, an ex post equilibrium with less communication complexity is desirable. The tradeoff between communication complexity and economic efficiency is discussed by Holzman, Kfir-Dahav, Monderer, and Tennenholtz (2003).\nn ≥ 3, every profile (b1, b2, · · · , bn) of strategies, which satisfies that any subprofile (bi)i∈N ′ , N ′ ⊆ N , is an ex post equilibrium in all VCG mechanisms is a symmetric profile of bundling strategies. That is, there exists ∅ ∈ Σ ⊆ 2A such that bi = f\nΣ for every i ∈ N , and moreover, it was proved by Holzman et al. (2003) that this Σ must be a quasi field."

      "heading" : "5.3 0-Implementation of ex post equilibrium in frugal VCG auction mechanisms",
      "text" : "We begin with a formal definition of a frugal VCG combinatorial auction:\nDefinition of Frugal VCG mechanisms A VCG mechanism (d, h) is called frugal if d does not allocate unnecessary goods to the buyers. That is, for every v̂ = (v̂1, . . . , v̂n) ∈ V N the mechanism selects an allocation d(v̂) = (d0(v̂), . . . , dn(v̂)) ∈ Γ, which is optimal for v̂ and satisfies in addition:\n• For every player i, and for every Bi ⊂ γi,\nv̂i(Bi) < v̂i(γi),\nwhere γi = di(v̂).\nIntuitively, in a frugal VCG mechanism the center never allocates unnecessary goods. If an agent has a bid for a bundle B1 and the same bid for a superset of it, B2, the center will never allocate B2 to that agent (the bid for B2 should be strictly higher than the bid for B1 in order that allocating B2 to that agent will be a possibility.)\nConsider an interested party who wishes to 0-implement the ex post equilibrium b = (b1, b2, · · · , bn) in the VCG auction mechanism (d, h). Given the result by Holzman and Monderer (2002) stated at the end of the previous subsection we can assume almost without loss of generality that bi = f\nΣ for every i ∈ N . The interested party wishes to promise a positive payment to every buyer i whenever he follows the recommendation to play according to bi, and at least one of the players, say j, does not play according to bj . However, the interested party does not know the valuation functions. Hence, how could she know whether a player follows the recommendation? Indeed she cannot. However, since Σ is known to the interested party she can partially monitor the players strategies, because, independently of a player’s valuation function his reported valuation function must be Σ-based. Hence, the best the interested party can do is to offer every player i a positive payment if his reported valuation is Σ-based, and at least one of the other players’ reported a valuation function, which is not Σ-based. These payments can be made arbitrarily high so that reporting a Σ-based valuation function will yield a higher payoff for i than any other, non Σ-based valuation function if at least one of the other players does not report a Σ-based valuation function. However, player i can cheat within the set of Σ-based valuations without being caught! It turns out that when the VCG mechanism is frugal, every player is better off not cheating.\nLemma 1 Let (d, h) be a frugal VCG mechanism, let Σ be a quasi field, and let i ∈ N . For every profile of reported valuations of the other players, v̂−i\nui(vi, v Σ i , v̂−i) ≥ ui(vi, wi, v̂−i) for every wi ∈ V Σ.\nProof: Without loss of generality we can assume that hj is constantly 0 for every j. Hence, the VCG mechanism is actually a VC mechanism. If v̂j is Σ-based for every j, j 6= i, the inequality follows from the fact that fΣ induces an ex post equilibrium. However, our proof does not use this fact. Let γ = d(vΣi , v̂−i) be the allocation chosen by the auctioneer when i reports vΣi , and let δ = d(wi, v̂−i). Denote\nt = max γ∈Γ\n∑\nj 6=i\nv̂j(γj).\nAs the VCG mechanism is frugal, we have that γi ∈ Σ and δi ∈ Σ. Therefore we have that vΣi (γi) = vi(γi), and v Σ i (δi) = vi(δi). By definition we have that ui(vi, v Σ i , v̂−i) = S(vi, v̂−i, γ)− t. Now since v Σ i (γi) = vi(γi) we have that ui(vi, v Σ i , v̂−i) = S(v Σ i , v̂−i, γ)− t. By the optimality of γ we get that S(vΣi , v̂−i, γ) − t ≥ S(v Σ i , v̂−i, δ) − t. However, since frugality also implies that vΣi (δi) = vi(δi), we get the following equation and the desired inequality:\nS(vΣi , v̂−i, δ) − t = S(vi, v̂−i, δ) − t = ui(vi, wi, v̂−i).¤\n.\nHence, in the proof of Lemma 1 we used the fact that a frugal VCG mechanism must allocate a subset of goods in Σ to every player who reports a Σ-based valuation function. The next example shows that Lemma 1 does not hold for an arbitrary VCG mechanism.\nExample\nThere are two buyers and four goods a,b,c,d.\nΣ = {∅, ab, cd, abcd}.\nThe valuation function of 1 is v1, and the reported valuation of 2 is v̂2. Consider a VC auction mechanism that allocate ab to 1 and cd to 2 when 1 reports vΣ1 , and it allocates abc to 1, and d to 2, when 1 reports the Σ-based valuation function w1. In both cases 1 pays 0. Hence, reporting vΣ1 yields a utility of 1, while cheating yields 1.1. Note that the VC mechanism is not frugal because when 1 declares w1 he receives abc, and w1(ab) = w1(abc).\n∅ a b c d ab ac ad bc bd cd abc abd acd bcd abcd v1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1.1 1 0 0 1.1 v̂2 0 0 0 0 0.75 0 0 0.75 0 0.75 0.75 0 0.75 0.75 0.75 0.75 vΣ1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1.1 w1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0.1 1 1 0.1 0.1 1.1\nWe need the following terminology. Let (d, h) be a VCG combinatorial auction, and let M̄ > 0. We denote by (d, h, M̄) the direct combinatorial auction with the rules induced by (d, h) in which, the set of feasible valuation functions ( and the set of bids) is V (M̄), which is the set of all valuation functions v satisfying v(A) < M̄. The assumption of an upper bound is natural but not common in the literature of mechanism design. It can be verified that Lemma 1 holds for a VCG combinatorial auctions with bounded valuation functions.\nTheorem 6 Let (d, h, M̄) be a frugal VCG auction mechanism with at least two buyers. Let Σ be a quasi fields of bundles. Then the symmetric ex post equilibrium induced by Σ is 0-implementable.\nProof: For every player i, the interested party promises i a very high payoff ( e.g., 2M̄ +1 if he reports a valuation function in V Σ, and at least one of the other players does not report a Σ-based valuation function. Player i is promised no payment if all players report valuation functions in V Σ. By Lemma 1, fΣ is a dominant strategy for every player.¤"

      "text" : "As we mentioned in Section 3, the proof of our result (Theorem 3) that every mixed strategy equilibrium is 0-implementable relies on the assumption that the interested party observes the mixed strategies used by the players. In this section we prove this result without this assumption. That is, the interested party can observe only the actions generated by the mixed strategies, but not the algorithms that generate them. In order to deal with this issue we define a new type of implementation by an implementation device.\nLet G(U) = (N,X,U) be a finite game in strategic form. An implementation device for G(U) is a tuple I = (S, h, Ṽ ), where S = S1 × S2 · · · × Sn, h ∈ ∆(S) is a probability distribution over S, and Ṽ : S×X → ℜn+. Si is the finite\n15 set of signals that can be sent to i. The interested party uses the implementation device I as follows: She makes the device public, she secretly runs a randomizing scheme that chooses every s ∈ S with a probability h(s). If s = (s1, s2, · · · , sn) is chosen, she sends player i the signal si. If the strategy profile x is selected then agent i is paid Ṽi(s, x). The implementation device generates a new game G(U, I). This is actually a Bayesian game. A strategy for i in this game is a function bi : Si → Xi. For every si and xi, and a vector b−i of the other players let Wi(xi|si, b−i) be the expected payoff of i in the game G(U, I) if it chooses xi given that it receives the signal si and all other players use b−i. That is,\nWi(xi|si, b−i) = Es−i (Ui(xi, b−i(s−i)) + Vi(si, s−i, xi, b−i(s−i)|si) ,\nwhere s−i = (sj)j 6=i, and b−i(s−i) = (bj(sj))j 6=i. A strategy bi is a dominant strategy for i if for every signal si with a positive probability ( that is ∑ t∈S,ti=si\nh(t) > 0), and for every b−i\nWi(bi(si)|si, b−i) ≥ Wi(xi|si, b−i) for every xi ∈ Xi,\nand there exists a profile b−i of the other players for which a strict inequality holds.\nEvery profile b = (bi)i∈N determines a probability distribution probb over X defined as follows:\nprobb(x) = h(b1 = x1, b2 = x2, · · · , bn = xn).\n15. If S is an infinite set, we must specify additional parameters required in probability theory. We associate with each Si a σ-algebra of events Σi, we endow S with the product σ-algebra, Σ, and we define h over Σ.\nLet ξ be a desired probability distribution over X. We say that I implements ξ in G(U), if in G(U, I) every player i has a dominant strategy bi, and probb = ξ. We say that I is a k-implementation of ξ in G(U) if I implements ξ, and for every s with h(s) > 0,\nn∑\ni=1\nṼi(si, bi(si)) ≤ k."

      "text" : "Aumann (1974) introduced the concept of correlated equilibrium. We provide one of the many equivalent definitions:\nDefinition Let G(U) = (N,X,U) be a finite game in strategic form. A correlated equilibrium of G(U) is a probability distribution ξ over X (ξ ∈ ∆(X)) such that the strategies bi(si) = si, si ∈ Xi, i ∈ N , form an equilibrium in the game G(U, I), where I = (S, h, Ṽ ) is the following implementation device:\n• S = X,\n• h = ξ,\n• Ṽi(s, x) = Ui(x) for every i ∈ N and for every s, x ∈ X.\nHence, ξ forms a correlated equilibrium if a mediator who makes no changes in the players’ payoff can run a randomization device according to ξ, picks a profile of pure actions s, and sends every player i the recommendation to play si, and every player is better off obeying the recommendation if she believes that all other players obey the recommendations. It is well-known ( and it was implicitly used in the proof of Theorem 7) that if p is a mixed strategy equilibrium, ξp is a correlated equilibrium. Moreover, going over the proof of Theorem 7 reveals that the only property of the mixed-strategy equilibrium p that we use is the fact that ξp is a correlated equilibrium. Hence we get:\nTheorem 8 Let G(U) = (N,X,U) be a finite game with at least two actions for every player. Every correlated equilibrium profile ξ is 0-implementable in G(U) with an appropriate implementation device I = (S, h, Ṽ ) in which, S = X and h = ξ.\nNote that eventually, when the interested party implements a mixed strategy equilibrium or a correlated equilibrium with the implementation device I, the players are using pure strategies in the game G(U, I). Because the expected value operator is linear, it can be easily seen that obeying the recommendation remains a dominant strategy for every player even if this player believes that the other players use mixed strategies in G(U, I), where a mixed strategy of i in G(U, I) is a probability distribution Qi over the set of his pure strategies. A mixed strategy is not a natural description of behavior in G(U, I). A more natural, and less computational demanding concept is the one of behavior strategy: A behavior strategy of i in the game G(U, I) is a function ci : Si → ∆(Xi). Hence, a player who is using a behavioral strategy chooses a mixed strategy in a game in strategic form as a function of his signal, while a player who is using a mixed strategy in G(U, I) is picking a pure strategy in G(U, I) with a randomization device before he receives the signal. The sets of mixed and behavioral strategies are not technically related to each other. However, by Kuhn (1953) ( see also Hart (1992) for details), for every player i, for every strategy bi of i and for every profile Q−i = (Qj)j 6=i of mixed strategies of the other players, there exists a profile c−i = (cj)j 6=i of behavioral strategies of the other players such that for every signal\nsi the expected utility of i when using bi given that all other players are using Q−i equals his expected utility when all other players are using c−i, and vice versa. 16\nHence, theorems 7 and 8 remain valid in an environment that allows the utilization of either mixed or behavioral strategies in G(U, I)."

      "heading" : "7. Conclusions, discussion and further research",
      "text" : "One may distinguish between two main lines of research in multi-agent systems. One line of research has to do with the design of mechanisms and protocols. In this context we in fact deal with the design of games, such that when agents are assumed to behave in particular way (e.g., be law-abiding, playing in equilibrium, reinforcement learners, etc.) then a desired behavior (e.g., revenue maximization, the maximization of social surplus, etc.) will be obtained. The other line of research deals with the study of the behavior of agents in a given game. In economic theory the leading paradigm in the last decades has been that agents use equilibrium strategies. However, this paradigm implicitly assumes that agents are rational and moreover, that agents believe that the other agents are rational.17\nIn this paper we introduced an intermediate approach. The game/interaction is given, and agents are not provided with newly designed protocol. The influence on agents’ behavior is only through credible promises for positive monetary transfers conditioned on the actions selected by the agents in the game. We also assume:\n1. Minimal rationality: we would like to assume as little as possible on agent rationality. Indeed all that we assume is that an agent will not use a strategy if it is dominated by another strategy.\n2. Minimal expenses: we assume that the interested party wishes to minimize its expenses while leading the agents to the desired behavior.\nThe notion of k-implementation captures the above basic ideas. In the paper we have provided several basic results about k-implementation. We have provided full characterization of k-implementation for the case of implementation of singletons in games with complete information. In particular we have shown a formula for computing the optimal k, which will yield the desired agent behavior, and fully specified a procedure for implementation. Our result is also applicable to a general class of games with infinitely many strategies. We have shown that such characterization is likely to be impossible for the implementation of sets of strategies. In particular, we have shown that the problem of whether the desired behavior can be implemented with a cost of k is NP-hard. This led us to considering exact k-implementation that we have shown to be tractable. Exact k-implementation requires that every desirable strategy profile will be rational as a result of the promises for monetary\n16. Actually, the theorem presented by Kuhn (1953) is stronger than the one we quote here. 17. In computer science the issue of how should an agent choose its action , unless he has a dominant strategy,\nis a central one and no general satisfactory solution is known. Researchers appeal in this case to the concept of competitive analysis (Borodin & El-Yaniv, 1998). In the context of games, some promising results in this direction are presented by Tennenholtz (2002).\ntransfers (in addition to the requirement that no undesirable strategy profile will remain rational). In a sense, exact implementation requires that the number of strategies that the system will ”remove” will be minimal. This is consistent with basic ideas of normative systems where in order to obtain desired behavior we would like to have minimal laws that leave maximal freedom to the agents as long as they will enable to obtain the desired (”social”) behavior. For a discussion of this issue see (Fitoussi & Tennenholtz, 2000).\nThe extension of our results to the context of mixed strategies can be interpreted as a strong evidence for the importance of Nash equilibrium from the normative perspective, and not only as a descriptive approach that attempts to explain/predict agent behavior in economic contexts. The fact that any mixed strategy equilibrium can made into a dominant one with zero payments given that we have a credible interested party, who cannot force behaviors or punish agents, tells us that in many practical situations Nash equilibrium has a special merit also from the normative perspective.\nThe games of incomplete information discussed in this section are games in informational form, rather than Bayesian games. This is in the spirit of work in computer science that tries to minimize probabilistic assumptions about the economic environment, and in particular the use of those as part of a solution concept. In this context the VCG mechanisms are probably the most central and widely studied mechanisms and we turn our attention to the study of k-implementation in the context of these mechanisms. Indeed, as we show, unlike in the case of finite games with complete information where there is always some large k that (if paid) can lead to any desired behavior, this is no longer true in games with incomplete information. The VCG mechanisms turn out to be very complex in their equilibrium analysis. As recent work has shown (Holzman et al., 2003) there are exponentially many equilibria of the VCG mechanisms that differ from truth telling. These are of special interest since these other equilibria exhibit lower communication complexity than the standard truth revealing equilibrium. Notice that these equilibria are obtained without any restriction on the possible bids by the agents (this is the so called no imposition property). The interested party has no access to the VCG protocol, and can influence it only indirectly. We have proved 0-implementation of any ex-post equilibrium of any frugal VCG mechanism, and that the frugality requirement is necessary.\nThere are many things left to be done. In particular, it will be interesting to further develop the study of k-implementation for better understanding the case of k > 0. For example, it may be interesting to study the effects of the cost of implementation on economic efficiency. Further study of tractable cases is also of interest. We are interested also in extending our study of k-implementation to games in informational form beyond the VCG mechanisms. The issue of collusion may have very interesting ramifications in the context of k-implementation. Collusive agreements may make benefit of the promises made by the interested party. Similarly, if failures in the system are possible, then the interested party might find itself paying its offers which he was hoping to ignore given rational behavior of the agents. We have also assumed that there is only one interested party. In a case that there are several interested parties who may wish to lead to different desired behaviors then a new strategic situation emerges. We believe that these issues are of significant importance. We hope to address some of them in future work, and that others will join us in the study of\nk-implementation and in exploring the spectrum between the system and agent perspectives in multi-agent systems."

The interested party cannot design a new game, cannot enforce agents’ behavior, cannot enforce payments by the agents, and cannot prohibit strategies available to the agents. However, he can influence the outcome of the game by committing to non-negative monetary transfers for the different strategy profiles that may be selected by the agents. The interested party assumes that agents are rational in the commonly agreed sense that they do not use dominated strategies. Hence, a certain subset of outcomes is implemented in a given game if by adding nonnegative payments, rational players will necessarily produce an outcome in this subset. Obviously, by making sufficiently big payments one can implement any desirable outcome. The question is what is the cost of implementation? In this paper we introduce the notion of k-implementation of a desired set of strategy profiles, where k stands for the amount of payment that need to be actually made in order to implement desirable outcomes. A major point in k-implementation is that monetary offers need not necessarily materialize when following desired behaviors. We define and study k-implementation in the contexts of games with complete and incomplete information. In the latter case we mainly focus on the VCG games. Our setting is later extended to deal with mixed strategies using correlation devices. Together, the paper introduces and studies the implementation of desirable outcomes by a reliable party who cannot modify game rules (i.e. provide protocols), complementing previous work in mechanism design, while making it more applicable to many realistic CS settings.",
