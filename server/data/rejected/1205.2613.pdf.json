      "text" : "This paper develops an inconsistency measure on conditional probabilistic knowledge bases. The measure is based on fundamental principles for inconsistency measures and thus provides a solid theoretical framework for the treatment of inconsistencies in probabilistic expert systems. We illustrate its usefulness and immediate application on several examples and present some formal results. Building on this measure we use the Shapley value—a well-known solution for coalition games—to define a sophisticated indicator that is not only able to measure inconsistencies but to reveal the causes of inconsistencies in the knowledge base. Altogether these tools guide the knowledge engineer in his aim to restore consistency and therefore enable him to build a consistent and usable knowledge base that can be employed in probabilistic expert systems."

      "text" : "Inconsistencies arise easily when experts share their knowledge in order to build a common knowledge base. Although these inconsistencies often affect only a little portion of the knowledge base or emerge from only little differences in the experts knowledge, they cause severe damage. Especially in knowledge bases that use classical logic as a means for knowledge representation, inconsistencies render the whole knowledge base useless, due to the well-known principle ex falso quodlibet. Therefore reasoning under inconsistency is an important field in AI and there are many proposals to deal with inconsistency in classical logic, e. g. (Rescher and Manor, 1970; Konieczny et al., 2005), or in other logical frameworks, e. g. paraconsistent logics (Bziau et al., 2007), default logics (Reiter, 1980),\ndefeasible logics (Billington, 2008), and argumentation theory (Bench-Capon and Dunne, 2007). Furthermore there are several approaches to analyze and measure inconsistency in qualitative frameworks, e. g. (Lozinskii, 1994; Benferhat et al., 1997; Knight, 2001; Hunter and Konieczny, 2004), and some in quantitative frameworks (mainly possibilistic frameworks), e. g. (Dubois et al., 1992).\nHere, we aim at analyzing inconsistencies in a probabilistic framework and in particular measuring inconsistency in conditional probabilistic knowledge bases (Nute and Cross, 2002; Kern-Isberner, 2001; Benferhat et al., 1999; Rödder and Meyer, 1996). In these, knowledge is captured using conditionals (A |B) that describe rules of the form “If B then A” and are interpreted using conditional probabilities. In contrast to probabilistic networks like Bayesian Networks (Pearl, 1998) conditional probabilistic knowledge bases do not demand the complete specification of every conditional probability of every probabilistic dependence and thus do not define a unique probability distribution as the underlying model. Nonetheless, using maximum entropy methods (Grove et al., 1994) one can determine a single probability distribution that describes the specified knowledge in an unbiased way. However, due to the unstructured approach of conditional probabilistic knowledge bases inconsistencies easily occur whereas Bayesian Networks forbid cyclic dependencies and so inconsistencies cannot arise by definition.\nThere is very little work on the treatment of inconsistencies in a conditional probabilistic framework (Rödder and Xu, 2001; Finthammer et al., 2007). The method described in (Finthammer et al., 2007) consists of a set of heuristics that are used to restore consistency in a knowledge base. Although this method is not based on a theoretical elaboration it works well in real-world examples and has been applied successfully to improve fraud detection in management. Other related work (Hansen and Jaumard, 1996; Andersen and Pretolani, 2001) investigates inconsistencies in classi-\ncal theories enriched with probabilistic semantics but without treatment of conditional probabilities as we do here. Furthermore the authors of (Hansen and Jaumard, 1996; Andersen and Pretolani, 2001) are mainly interested in efficient algorithms for determining whether a knowledge base is inconsistent and not to what degree.\nThe main contribution of this paper consists of the development of an inconsistency measure on conditional probabilistic knowledge bases that is based on fundamental principles that are desired from inconsistency measures in general. Furthermore we apply the approach taken in (Hunter and Konieczny, 2006) on our framework and use the Shapley value (Shapley, 1953) to define a more sophisticated inconsistency measure based on the basic inconsistency measure developed before. Using this Shapley inconsistency measure we are able to determine not only the degree of inconsistency but also the contributors to it, i. e. the conditionals that are responsible for the inconsistency.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we start with some necessary preliminaries and a description of the basic framework. Afterwards in Section 3 we discuss the basic problem of determining consistency in the basic framework. In Section 4 we go on by stating some desirable properties of an inconsistency measure on probabilistic knowledge bases in general and propose a measure that fulfills these properties. In order to be able to determine the causes of inconsistency we continue in Section 5 by introducing a more sophisticated measure based on the Shapley value and the basic inconsistency measure introduced before. In Section 6 we conclude."

      "text" : "We are working with a propositional framework of random variables. Let V = {V1, . . . , Vn} be a set of propositional variables with finite domains Dom(V1), . . . ,Dom(Vn). The set V is assumed to be given for all upcoming definitions. An expression of the form Vi = vi is called a literal if vi is in the domain of Vi, i. e. vi ∈ Dom(Vi). The language LV is generated using the connectives ¬, ∧, and ∨ on the literals in V in the usual way. We abbreviate conjunctions A∧B by AB and negation ¬A by overlining A. If V is a binary variable, i. e., it is Dom(V ) = {true, false}, we abbreviate V = true by just V and V = false by V . We write > for tautological formulas, e. g. A ∨ A = >. A complete conjunction or interpretation is a conjunction of literals where every Vi ∈ V appears exactly once. If ω is a complete conjunction, then ω |= (Vi = vi) if and only of Vi = vi appears in ω. For an arbitrary formula B the expression ω |= B evaluates in the usual way.\nLet Ω be the set of all complete conjunctions of V, i. e., the set of all interpretations of the propositional language induced by V.\nProbabilistic knowledge bases are build using probabilistic constraints, that impose certain restrictions on the conditional probabilities of the models of the knowledge base. A probabilistic constraint r is an expression of the form (A |B)[d] with formulas A,B and d ∈ [0, 1]. If B = > we write (A)[d] instead of (A | >)[d]. A set of probabilistic constraints R = {r1, . . . , rm} is called a knowledge base. Let R denote the set of all knowledge bases. The models of a knowledge base R are the probability distributions PR : Ω→ [0, 1] that fulfill all restrictions on the conditional probabilities imposed by the probabilistic constraints in R. More specific, a probability distribution PR : Ω → [0, 1] is a model for a knowledge base R, written PR |= R, if and only if PR |= r for every r ∈ R. That is\nPR |= (A |B)[d] :⇔ PR(A |B) = d ⇔ PR(AB) = d · P (B)\nwith PR(A) = ∑ ω∈Ω,ω|=A PR(ω) .\nObserve, that we used the notation PR(AB) = d·P (B) to express that the conditional probability of PR(A |B) is d in order to avoid a case differentiation for PR(B) = 0. For the rest of this paper, we assume that all probabilistic constraints are self-consistent, i. e., for every singleton set {r} with r being a probabilistic constraint we assume that {r} has a model. For example, we forbid constraints of the form (A |A)[d] with d > 0 and the like.\nA knowledge base R made of probabilistic constraints describes incomplete knowledge. Usually, one is interested in performing inductive representation techniques and thus in computing a single probability distribution that describes R best and thus gives a complete description of the problem area at hand. This can be done using methods based on maximum entropy, which feature several nice properties (Paris, 1994; Grove et al., 1994; Kern-Isberner, 2001; Rödder and Meyer, 1996). Although these methods are not the topic of the present paper, consistency is a necessary requirement for their application."

Let R be a knowledge base. For a probability distribution PR : Ω → [0, 1] to be a model of R, every probabilistic constraint (A |B)[d] ∈ R imposes PR(A |B) = d to hold. Let Mod(A) = {ω ∈ Ω |ω |= A} be the set of all models of the formula A. For every complete conjunction ω ∈ Ω we introduce a variable αω that determines the unknown value of PR(ω). Then (A |B)[d] translates to∑\nω∈Mod(AB)\nαω = d · ∑\nω∈Mod(B)\nαω .

Proposition 1. Let R be a knowledge base. R is consistent if and only if CSR has a solution.\nThe proof of Proposition 1 is straightforward as every assignment of values to the variables αω, that is legal with respect to the constraint satisfaction problem CSR, directly corresponds to a probability distribution PR with PR(ω) = αω. Hence, if there is an assignment for all αω the corresponding probability distribution PR is a model for all probabilistic constraints r ∈ R and therefore a model for R."

      "text" : "Let Inc be a function Inc : R → [0,∞] that maps a knowledge base R ∈ R onto a positive real. We desire several properties of Inc in order of Inc describing an inconsistency measure. Some of the following properties are adapted from (Hunter and Konieczny, 2006) and rewritten to fit a probabilistic framework. Intuitively we want Inc to be a function on knowledge bases that is monotonically increasing with the inconsistency in the knowledge base. If the knowledge base is consistent, Inc shall be minimal. For the upcoming definitions let R be an arbitrary knowledge base and r, r′ be probabilistic constraints.\n(Consistency) If R is consistent, then Inc(R) = 0.\n(Inconsistency) If R is inconsistent, then Inc(R) > 0.\nThe above properties ensure that Inc is indeed an inconsistency measure and not an information measure (Cover, 2001) as it should not distinguish between different consistent knowledge bases but measure inconsistent ones.\n(Monotonicity) It is Inc(R) ≤ Inc(R ∪ {r}).\n(Super-Additivity) If R∩R′ = ∅, it is Inc(R∪R′) ≥ Inc(R) + Inc(R′).\nThe measure of inconsistency can only increase when new pieces of information are added to the knowledge base. Thus inconsistencies cannot be resolved with new information. (Super-Additivity) is the stronger property, as it can be easily seen that (SuperAdditivity) implies (Monotonicity).\n(Weak Independence) If no literal in r is mentioned in R, then it is Inc(R) = Inc(R ∪ {r}).\nAs we assume that all probabilistic constraints are selfconsistent, the addition of a constraint not involving any parts of the language mentioned yet shall not lead to an increase in the inconsistency.\nWe say that r is a free constraint iff for every set R′ ⊆ R such that R′ is inconsistent and minimal with this property, it is r /∈ R′. Then we can strengthen the above property as follows.\n(Independence) If r is a free constraint in R ∪ {r}, then it is Inc(R) = Inc(R ∪ {r}).\nThis property ensures that not only constraints that do not use literals previously mentioned cannot increase inconsistency, but also constraints that do not take part in any inconsistency of the knowledge base do so. It is easy to see that satisfaction of the second property implies satisfaction of the first property.\nProposition 2. If Inc satisfies (Independence), then Inc satisfies (Weak Independence).\nThe previous two properties describe cases where the inconsistency of a knowledge base should remain constant despite the addition of new information. Conversely, the next property describes a case when the inconsistency should increase.\n(Penalty) If r is not a free constraint in R∪{r}, then it is Inc(R) < Inc(R ∪ {r}).\nSimilar to the motivation for (Independence) we state that if a probabilistic constraint r contributes to a minimal inconsistent subset of the knowledge base, then the inconsistency must be strictly greater than in the knowledge base without r.\nSo far we have not taken into account that we are working in a probabilistic framework. It is hard to grasp in what way the probabilities of the conditionals influence the inconsistency of the whole knowledge base. Consider a knowledge base R and a probabilistic constraint (A |B)[d] ∈ R. How should the inconsistency measure Inc behave when increasing (or decreasing) the value d? There is no definite answer to this question as, on the one hand, the inconsistency may vanish because the constraint may become consistent with the rest of the knowledge base, or, on the other hand, the inconsistency may rise because the constraint may remove itself from a “consistent state”. But one demand can be made: The change in the measure of inconsistency should be continuous in d. If one does only slightly change a given knowledge base, the resulting inconsistency measure should have only changed slightly as well. We formalize this intuition as follows.\nDefinition 1 (Characteristic function). Let R = {(A1 |B1)[d1], . . . , (An |Bn)[dn]} be a knowledge base. The function ΛR : [0, 1]n → R with\nΛR(x1, . . . , xn) = {(A1 |B1)[x1], . . . , (An |Bn)[xn]}\nis called the characteristic function of R.\nDefinition 2 (Characteristic Inconsistency function). Let R be a knowledge base with |R| = n. The function θInc,R : [0, 1]n → [0,∞] with θInc,R = Inc ◦ ΛR is called the characteristic inconsistency function of Inc and R.\nThe above definitions allow us to state our last property in a concise way as follows.\n(Continuity) The characteristic inconsistency function θInc,R is continuous in all arguments."

      "heading" : "4.2 An Inconsistency Measure",
      "text" : "In this subsection we develop an inconsistency measure on probabilistic knowledge bases that fulfills the basic properties described above. For this reason, we extend the consistency test from the previous section by including variables that measure the deviation of the values of the probabilistic constraints from consistent ones in a minimal way. But first, consider the following remark.\nRemark 1. For every set R′ = {(A1 |B1), . . . , (An |Bn)} of qualitative conditionals (neglecting the probabilistic values) there are reals d1, . . . , dn ∈ [0, 1], such that R = {(A1 |B1)[d1], . . . , (An |Bn)[dn]} is consistent.\nThis is easy to see, because one can consider any probability distribution P and assign di := P (Ai |Bi). As we only consider self-consistent constraints, every value is computable. Bearing this observation in mind, let R = {(A1 |B1)[d1], . . . , (An |Bn)[dn]} be a knowledge base. For every i = 1, . . . , n we introduce variables ηi, τi ∈ [0, 1] that measure the positive and negative minimal deviations of the value of the probabilistic constraint (Ai |Bi)[di]. In the following, we define an optimization problem, that minimizes the deviation of R to a consistent knowledge base. To this end, we have to modify the probabilistic constraints in R in a minimal way, such that the knowledge base R′ with the modified constraints is consistent, i. e., there is a probability distribution PR′ that is a model for R′. As before let αω denote the probability of a complete conjunction ω ∈ Ω. For every constraint (Ai |Bi)[di], i = 1, . . . , n we write∑\nω∈Mod(AiBi)\nαω = (di + ηi − τi) · ∑\nω∈Mod(Bi)\nαω (4)\nto comprehend for the fact that the modified probabilistic constraint (Ai |Bi)[di + ηi − τi] imposes PR′(Ai |Bi) = di + ηi − τi1. To ensure well-formed constraints we also have to consider the following normalization constraints\n0 ≤ d1 + η1 − τ1 ≤ 1, . . . , 0 ≤ dn + ηn − τn ≤ 1 (5)\nand as before ∑ ω∈Ω αω = 1 (6)\n∀ω ∈ Ω : αω ≥ 0 . (7)\nWe denote with OPTR the set of constraints (4), (5), (6), and (7) for a knowledge base R. In order to determine the minimal necessary deviation of R from a consistent knowledge base, we formulate an optimization problem by minimizing the function\nf(η1, . . . , ηn, τ1, . . . , τn) = η1 + . . .+ ηn + τ1 + . . .+ τn\ngiven OPTR. Let Inc∗(R) denote the solution for f in this optimization problem and let η∗1 , . . . , η ∗ n, τ ∗ 1 , . . . , τ ∗ n be the parameters for a minimal value. Considering again Remark 1, there is always a solution for the optimization problem defined above.\nProposition 3. For every knowledge base R, the value Inc∗(R) is well-defined.\nAs not all constraints in this optimization problem are strictly convex, the values of η∗1 , . . . , η ∗ n, τ ∗ 1 , . . . , τ ∗ n do not have to be unique in general (Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004). But some straightforward observations can be made on the value of Inc∗.\nProposition 4. If η∗i > 0 then τ ∗ i = 0 and if τ ∗ i > 0 then η∗i = 0. Proposition 5. Let R = {(A1 |B1)[d1], . . . , (An |Bn)[dn]} be a knowledge base, then it is\n0 ≤ Inc∗(R) ≤ ∑\n1≤i≤n\nmax(di, 1− di) ≤ n .\nFor any specific knowledge base R Proposition 5 states that the value of Inc∗(R) is bounded above by the number of conditionals in R. By exploiting this observation one can define a normalized inconsistency measure by\nInc∗0(R) =def { 0 if R = ∅ Inc∗(R) |R | otherwise\n1We explicitly distinguish between positive (ηi) and negative (τi) deviations to avoid determining absolute values when summing the deviations (see below).\nwith values between zero and one for any knowledge base R. However, we will go on by investigating the properties of the unnormalized inconsistency measure Inc∗, which naturally apply to the normalized inconsistency measure Inc∗0 as well. Example 1. Consider the knowledge base R1 = {r1, r2, r3, r4} with r1 = (A |B)[0.8], r2 = (A |B)[0.6], r3 = (B)[0.5], and r4 = (A)[0.2]. Here, it is Inc∗(R1) = 0.5 with η∗1 = τ ∗ 1 = η ∗ 2 = τ ∗ 2 = η ∗ 3 = τ ∗ 3 = τ ∗ 4 = 0 and η∗4 = 0.5. Therefore, the fourth constraint (A)[0.2] has to be adjusted to (A)[0.7] in order to restore consistency (this is just one possible adjustment). Example 2. Consider the knowledge base R2 = {r1, r2, r3} with r1 = (A |B)[1], r2 = (B)[1], and r3 = (A)[0]. Here, it is Inc∗(R2) = 1 with η∗1 = η ∗ 2 = τ∗2 = η ∗ 3 = τ ∗ 3 = 0 and τ ∗ 1 = 1.\nAs the next example shows, it must not always be a single probabilistic constraint, that has to be modified in order to restore consistency. Example 3. Consider the knowledge base R3 = {r1, r2, r3, r4, r5} with r1 = (A |C)[0.7], r2 = (B |C)[0.8], r3 = (A)[0.2], r4 = (B)[0.3], and r5 = (C)[0.5]. Here, it is Inc∗(R2) = 0.25 with η∗1 = τ ∗ 1 = η∗2 = τ ∗ 2 = τ ∗ 3 = τ ∗ 4 = 0 and η ∗ 3 = 0.15 and η ∗ 4 = 0.1.\nWe show now that Inc∗ is indeed an appropriate inconsistency measure for probabilistic knowledge bases as it satisfies the desired properties described in the previous section. Proposition 6. The function Inc∗ satisfies (Consistency), (Inconsistency), (Monotonicity), (SuperAdditivity), (Weak Independence), (Independence), (Penalty), and (Continuity).\nAs mentioned before Proposition 6 also applies to the normalized inconsistency measure Inc∗0. This is especially true for the property (Continuity) as for R = ∅ the function θInc∗0 ,R trivializes to the constant (and therefore continuous) function θInc∗0 ,R = 0."

      "text" : "In Example 2 it has been shown, that the first constraint (A |B)[1] had to be modified in order to restore consistency of the knowledge base R2. This might tempt to make the assumption that this constraint is alone responsible for the inconsistency in R2. But if one looks at R2 in more depth, one can see that the situation is symmetrical in all three constraints. The optimization problem has more than one solution, as for example η∗2 = 1 also solves the inconsistency (with all other values being zero) with the same inconsistency measure of one. In fact, most inconsistent knowledge\nbases feature this behavior, as for the optimization problem it is best to alter as less values of the probabilistic constraints as possible. Usually, one is not only interested in determining a simple value of inconsistency, but to determine the causes of the inconsistency and ultimately to restore consistency. In Example 2 all three constraints are equally responsible for producing the inconsistency in R2. In order to achieve a more in-depth analysis of the inconsistency in probabilistic knowledge bases in general, we apply the same technique as in (Hunter and Konieczny, 2006), where the Shapley value (Shapley, 1953) is used to determine the causes of inconsistency in propositional knowledge bases.\nWe go one by giving a short overview over coalition game theory and the role of the Shapley value in it, followed by the definition of the Shapley inconsistency measure on probabilistic knowledge bases."

      "text" : "Coalition game theory is concerned with games, where players can form coalitions in order to maximize their own payoff of the game. Let P denote the power set. Definition 3 (Coalition Game). A coalition game (N, v) is composed of a set of players N ⊆ N and a function v : P(N)→ R with v(∅) = 0 and v(S ∪ T ) ≥ v(S) + v(T ) for S, T ⊆ N with S ∩ T = ∅.\nFor every possible coalition C ⊆ N of players in the game, the value v(C) determines the payoff this coalition gets. As this payoff must be distributed on the members of C, every player has to evaluate for his own, which coalition to form in order to maximize his own expected payoff. Not every player has to expect the same payoff for himself, as players may be more or less important for the forming of coalitions. Example 4 (taken from (Hunter and Konieczny, 2006)). LetN = {1, 2, 3} and the function v : P(N)→ R be defined as\nv({1}) = 1 v({2}) = 0 v({3}) = 1 v({1, 2}) = 10 v({2, 3}) = 11 v({1, 3}) = 4\nv({1, 2, 3}) = 12\nIn this game, not every player should expect the same payoff, as for instance it is more advantageous for player 1 to form a coalition with player 2 rather than with player 3 alone.\nA solution to a coalition game (N, v) consists of an assignment Si(v) of payoffs to each player i ∈ N , that is fair in the sense that every player gets as much payoff as his contribution in the grand coalition N weighs. Some formal desirable properties of a solution are as follows.\n(Efficiency) ∑\ni∈N Si(v) = v(N)\n(Symmetry) For all i, j ∈ N , if v(C ∪ {i}) = v(C ∪ {j}) for all C ⊆ N \\ {i, j} then Si(v) = Sj(v)\n(Dummy) If for i ∈ N it is v(C) = v(C ∪ {i}) for all C ⊆ N then it is Si(v) = 0\n(Additivity) Si(v + w) = Si(v) + Si(w)\nA solution should comprehend for the fact, that the value to be distributed among the players is the maximal value that can be achieved (Efficiency). If two players are indistinguishable by their contributions to the coalitions, they deserve the same payoff (Symmetry); if a player does not contribute to any coalition at all, his payoff should be zero (Dummy). (Additivity) describes the desired behavior of a solution if two coalition games are combined.\nIt can be shown (Shapley, 1953), that the Shapley value defined as follows is the only solution for a coalition game that satisfies (Efficiency), (Symmetry), (Dummy), and (Additivity).\nDefinition 4 (Shapley Value). Let (N, v) be a coalition game. The Shapley Value Si(v) for a player i ∈ N is defined as Si(v) = ∑\nC⊆N\n(|C| − 1)!(|N | − |C|)! |N |! (v(C)− v(C \\ {r})\nExample 5 ((Hunter and Konieczny, 2006)).

We define the probabilistic Shapley inconsisteny measure SKInc(r) of r in K as SKInc(r) = ∑\nC⊆K\n(|C| − 1)!(n− |C|)! n!

In the following we use the inconsistency measure Inc∗ developed in the previous section for the application of the Shapley inconsistency measure. Example 6. Consider again the knowledge base R1 = {r1, r2, r3, r4} with r1 = (A |B)[0.8], r2 = (A |B)[0.6], r3 = (B)[0.5], and r4 = (A)[0.2] from Example 1 with Inc∗(R1) = 0.5.

The distribution of the Shapley values indicates that the constraint r4 = (A)[0.2] is mostly responsible for the inconsistency in R1 and r3 = (B)[0.5] is less responsible. This can be justified as both rules r1 and r2 describe an influence of B on A and – assuming that the knowledge base describes causal rather that diagnostic information – thus state that B is more entrenched or more basic than A. Thus, rule r4 that gives a probability of A not conditioned on anything else, is most dangerous for consistency. Example 7. Consider again the knowledge base R2 = {r1, r2, r3} with r1 = (A |B)[1], r2 = (B)[1], and r3 = (A)[0] from Example 2 with Inc∗(R2) = 1. There it is SR2Inc∗(r1) ≈ 0.33, S R2 Inc∗(r2) ≈ 0.33, and SR2Inc∗(r3) ≈ 0.33. Here it is clear, that all three probabilistic constraints are equally responsible for the inconsistency in R2. This reflects the intuition described above. Example 8. Consider again the knowledge base R3 = {r1, r2, r3, r4, r5} with r1 = (A |C)[0.7], r2 = (B |C)[0.8], r3 = (A)[0.2], r4 = (B)[0.3], and r5 = (C)[0.5] from Example 3 with Inc∗(R3) = 0.25.

If Inc is an inconsistency measure that satisfies (Consistency) and (Super-Additivity), then the probabilistic Shapley inconsistency measure SInc satisfies\n(Efficiency) ∑\nr∈R S R Inc(r) = Inc(R)\n(Symmetry) For all r, r′ ∈ R, if Inc(R′ ∪ {r}) = Inc(R′∪{r′}) for all R′ ⊆ R\\{r, r′} then SRInc(r) = SInc(r′)\n(Dummy) If for r ∈ R it is Inc(R′) = Inc(R′ ∪ {r}) for all R′ ⊆ R then it is SRInc(r) = 0\nThe property (Additivity) was neglected as it does not make sense for our application, cf. (Hunter and Konieczny, 2006). From Proposition 7 it follows directly\nCorollary 1. The probabilistic Shapley inconsistency measure SInc∗ satisfies (Efficiency), (Symmetry), and (Dummy).\nUsing the inconsistency measure Inc∗ and the Shapley inconsistency measure SRInc∗ the knowledge engineer can support his efforts to restore consistency in a probabilistic knowledge base R. The solutions of the optimization problem OPTR describe the minimal adjustments to be made in order to restore consistency. By considering the Shapley inconsistency measures SRInc∗ for the constraints in R one can select the most appropriate solution and modify the knowledge base accordingly. We will formalize this approach of restoring consistency using inconsistency measures in an upcoming paper."

      "heading" : "6 Summary and Discussion",
      "text" : "We developed an inconsistency measure on conditional probabilistic knowledge bases and showed that this measure satisfies several desirable properties. We went on by using this measure and the well-known Shapley value to define a more sophisticated measure that gives the knowledge engineer the means to restore consistency of a knowledge base by identifying the causes for the inconsistency. Due to its heritage from the Shapley value the Shapley inconsistency measure satisfies several nice properties.\nThe examples in this paper were computed by a prototypical implementation of the function Inc∗ and SRInc∗ in Java which uses the free optimization software OpenOpt2 to solve the optimization problems of type OPTR.\nThe inconsistency measure described here and inconsistency measures in general are useful when dealing with data from heterogenous sources as in information fusion or belief revision (Bloch and Hunter, 2001; Alchourrón et al., 1985; Kern-Isberner and Rödder, 2003). They can point at discrepancies in the data representation and give hints on possible fixes within the model. Many expert systems in highly-crucial application areas like medical diagnosis or fraud detection demand to draw consistent conclusions but need to use distorted and ambiguous information at the same time. Actually, we are currently investigating the possibilities of applying information engineering techniques as the described inconsistency measure and information fusion in the field of fraud detection in the annual audit relating to commercial law. For future work we also plan to extend and apply the work reported here on relational probabilistic knowledge bases.\n2http://openopt.org/\nAcknowledgments.

The measure is based on fundamental principles for inconsistency measures and thus provides a solid theoretical framework for the treatment of inconsistencies in probabilistic expert systems. We illustrate its usefulness and immediate application on several examples and present some formal results. Building on this measure we use the Shapley value—a well-known solution for coalition games—to define a sophisticated indicator that is not only able to measure inconsistencies but to reveal the causes of inconsistencies in the knowledge base. Altogether these tools guide the knowledge engineer in his aim to restore consistency and therefore enable him to build a consistent and usable knowledge base that can be employed in probabilistic expert systems.",
