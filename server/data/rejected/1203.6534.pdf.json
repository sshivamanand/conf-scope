      "text" : "Given an undirected graph G = (V, E) with V the vertices and E the edges, a spanning tree x of G is a connected and acyclic partial graph of G. x is then always composed with |V| − 1 edges. We denote by SST(G) the spanning trees set of G. For short, we write: e ∈ x, with e ∈ E, to say: e is an edge of the spanning tree x. More generally, we will assimilate x to its edges set. The classical problem of maximum spanning tree (⇔ ST/Σu/OPT) is defined as follow:\nST/Σu/OPT: Given an undirected graph G = (V, E) and a utility u(e) associated with each edge e ∈ E, the result is a feasible spanning tree x of G, maximizing the sum of utilities of edges in x, if such a tree exists. Otherwise, the result is ‘no’.\nSeveral consistency problems have been recently investigated on spanning trees. On the one hand, we note the consistency problem associated with feasible spanning trees of a graph [25]. Other investigations pointed out consistency associated with weighted spanning trees [8], and maximum spanning tree [9]. On the other hand, numerous local consistency problems combining classical spanning tree problems with other constraints have been investigated. For example, the diameter constrained minimum spanning tree problem (DCMST) [16].\nWithin non-conventional preferences, the situation is radically different. Very few consistency spanning tree problems have been investigated in literature. We cite a local consistency problem processed for the robust spanning tree problem with interval data (RSTID) [1].\nYet, the most of combinatorial problems from the real practical world require the modeling of imprecision or uncertainty, multiple divergent viewpoints and conflicts management, to wholly assess the solutions and to identify the best compromise ones. These singularities require more complex modeling of preferences [27, 21]. For now some decades, the OR/CP community scrutinizes combinatorial problems enabling non-conventional global preferences. Thus, we attended to the flowering of a great number of publications dealing with multiobjective combinatorial optimization problems (see [10, 3] for surveys). Nevertheless, a very few articles dealt with combinatorial problems with purely ordinal and/or intransitive preferential information. We mention the recent investigations in the scope of (i) decision theory with maximal spanning trees and maximal paths in a digraph [18], (ii) game theory with stable matchings (see [20] for a survey), (iii) algebraic combinatorial optimization [28, 5], or (iv) artificial intelligence with some configuration problems [4, 14] and with heuristic search algorithms [17, 14]. We decide to bring another stone to this building, with the concept of preferential consistency applied to the topological sorting-based maximal spanning trees problem.\nThe decision problematic of finding a suitable preferred solution is semi-structured: in the general case (beyond total preorders), a preferred solution fitted to the decision-maker cannot be only identified from the implemented preferential information. Preferred solutions are not all equivalent, some are partially comparable others are incomparable, and sometimes, there exists no optimal or maximal solution [27, 21]. To investigate these semi-computable problems, we will use the concept of Decision Support System (DSS) to explore the preferred solutions set. This exploration can be achieved other than by building iteratively new preferred solutions – as usually in multicriteria optimization –; For example, by describing this preferred set with the set of values present in at least one preferred solution. The notion of consistency, defined in Constraint Programming, gathers the theoretical surrounding of this descriptive approach of implicit sets. This is a reactive [26] and deductive approach of solving; In a polynomial number of actions (removings, instantiations and backtrackings), the user leads to a preferred solution.\nConsequently, after an introduction on preference relations (§ 2.1), we make a brief presentation on compact representation of preferences (§ 2.2). We next point out a generalization of the maximum spanning trees problem: the maximal spanning trees problem (§ 3.1). So, we introduce (§ 3.2) preferential consistency,\na Accepted in: Workshop on modeling and solving problems with constraints (ECAI 2008-W31), Patras, Greece, 21 july 2008 : 30-38. * Université des Antilles et de la Guyane / Institut d'Etudes Supérieures de Guyane, French Guyana, France, e-mail : remy.joseph@caramail.com\ni.e. a template redefining consistency in order to take into account of peculiarities of combinatorial problems exploiting non-conventional preferences, followed by its using on the maximal spanning trees. In general, most of relevant computable problems supporting the initial decision problem are intractable. Accordingly, we point out an easy suitable maximal spanning trees sub-problem (§ 4), based on a compact preference representation inspired by topological sorting (§ 4.1). In § 4.2, we give an example of using in the multicriteria context and we compare this sub-problem with the Pareto-based multiobjective version. Next, we design a global preferential consistency algorithm (§ 5) dedicated to it. We conclude (§ 6) with some perspectives."

      "text" : "Given a non-empty finite set S, a (crisp binary) preference relation [23, 27, 21] ≽ of an individual on S is a reflexive binary relation on S (⇔ ≽ ⊆ S × S and ∀ x ∈ S, (x, x) ∈ ≽) translating some judgments of this individual concerning his preferences between the alternative elements of S. For every couple of elements x and y of S, the assertion « x ≽ y » is equivalent to « (x, y) ∈ ≽ » and means that « x is at least as good quality as y for considered individual ». A preference relation ≽ carries out a partition of S × S into four fundamental relations:\n(indifference) x ≃ y ⇔ ( x ≽ y and y ≽ x ) for all x, y ∈ S (strict preference) x ≻ y ⇔ ( x ≽ y and not(y ≽ x) ) for all x, y ∈ S (strict aversion) x ≺ y ⇔ y ≻ x for every x, y ∈ S (incomparability) x ∥ y ⇔ ( not(x ≽ y) and not(y ≽ x) ) for every x, y ∈ S Preference relations defined on a finite set formally correspond\nwith the concept of simple directed graphs (shortly digraphs). Accordingly, the graphical representation of digraphs will allow us to illustrate our investigation. For every non-empty A ⊆ S, the restriction of ≽ to A is the preference relation ≽|A defined as follow: ≽|A = {(x, y) ∈ A × A, such that: x ≽ y}. By abuse, we do not specify the restriction, the context enabling to identify the targeted subset of S. A preference relation ≽ is: • transitive iff [x ≽ y and y ≽ z] ⇒ x ≽ z, for all x, y, z ∈ S • quasi-transitive iff [x ≻ y and y ≻ z] ⇒ x ≻ z, for all x, y, z ∈\nS iff the strict preference relation is transitive • P-acyclic iff ∀ t > 2 and ∀ x1, x2, …, xt ∈ S,\n[x1 ≻ x2 ≻ … ≻ xt] ⇒ not(xt ≻ x1) iff ≽ has no circuit of strict preference.\n• an equivalence relation iff it is reflexive1, symmetric and transitive • a partial preorder iff it is reflexive and transitive\n1 Mention that a binary relation ≽ is symmetric iff x ≽ y ⇒ y ≽ x, for all x, y ∈ S; antisymmetric iff x ≽ y ⇒ not(y ≽ x), for all x, y ∈ S with x ≠ y; and complete (or total) iff x ≽ y or y ≽ x, for all x, y ∈ S and x ≠ y.\n• a complete (or total) preorder iff it is reflexive, transitive and complete • a complete (or total) order iff it is reflexive, transitive, antisymmetric and complete\nGiven a finite non-empty set S structured by a preference relation ≽, the maximal set (or efficient set) of S according to ≽, denoted M(S, ≽), is the subset of S verifying: M(S, ≽) = {x ∈ S | ∀ y ∈ S, not(y ≻ x)}; while the optimal set of S according to ≽, denoted B(S, ≽), is the subset of S verifying: B(S, ≽) = {x ∈ S | ∀ y ∈ S, x ≽ y}. Of course, there exists other choices of axioms identifying preferred (i.e. best quality, or best compromise) solutions from a preference relation, and we refer to [11, 24] for a deepening.\nGiven a preference relation ≽ on a finite set S, another preference relation ≽’ on S is an extension of ≽ if ∀ x, y ∈ S, x ≻ y ⇒ x ≻’ y. The relation ≽’ is called a linear extension of ≽ if ≽’ is an extension of ≽ and ≽’ is a total order. We have the following result (see [23]): a preference relation ≽ on a finite set S is P-acyclic ⇔ every non empty subset of S has a non empty maximal set (⇔ ∀ ∅ ≠ A ⊆ S, M(A, ≽) ≠ ∅) ⇔ there exists linear extensions of ≽ and they are obtained by topological sorting."

      "text" : "In combinatorial practical applications, solutions are implicit: described by a set S of elementary components of a set E (⇔ S ⊆ P(E)). Then, it is necessary to imagine a compact representation of preferences for their elicitation (acquisition) and their processing; because these operations with an explicit representation – the listing of the couples x, y ∈ S such that x ≽ y – being usually intractable. Thus, in classical combinatorial optimization, the preferences are represented by a utility function u from P(E) to ℝ to maximize: x ≽ y ⇔ u(x) ≥ u(y). In multicriteria optimization based on the Pareto dominance, preferences are represented by a vector of utility functions (u1, …, up), aggregated by the Pareto dominance: x ≽ y ⇔ [∀ i ∈ {1, …, p}, ui(x) ≥ ui(y)]. This hierarchical aggregation will be noted pΣu>PARETO. And more generally, every aggregation of a family of p utility functions by a rule AR will be noted pΣu>AR. In artificial intelligence, numerous compact representations of preferences appeared: from CP-nets [4, 14] to constraints describing the preferential neighbourhood of the solutions (called preferential constraints in [13]), by going through soft constraints [3, 19] and dynamic CSP [26]. In the following, any compact representation of a preference relation ≽ is denoted I(≽). We will present in § 4.1 the compact representation used here for our maximal spanning trees sub-problem."

Denoted by\nDS(ST/CBPR/MAX), this semi-structured problem is formulated in the following way:\nDS(ST/CBPR/MAX): Given an undirected graph G = (V, E) and a compact representation I(≽) of a preference relation ≽ on P(E), the result is a feasible spanning tree which is: (i) maximal for (SST(G), ≽), if such a solution exists, and (ii)suited with the system of values of the user. Otherwise, the result is ‘no’.\nRemark 1. DS and CBPR mean respectively decision support and crisp binary preference relation. The condition (ii) means the user via an interactive process will treat the lack of equivalence and the incompleteness between maximal solutions. This definition of problem involves that the satisficing solution, must be also maximal in (SST(G), ≽). In other words, the only degree of freedom let to the DSS user is the choice of a suited solution among the maximal ones. This definition refers for example to contexts where preferences have been given by the different actors of the decision problem, next aggregated in global – possibly incomplete and intransitive – preferences ≽ on the solutions P(E) via a compact representation I(≽); Now, an individual: the user, being able to bring efficiently forgotten preferential information at different times of the decision process, is in charge of finding the suited solution mirroring at best global preferences.\nAt this semi-structured problem is associated the computable problem of finding a maximal spanning tree, denoted ST/CBPR/MAX, the definition of which corresponds with the DS(ST/CBPR/MAX) one, after erasing the property (ii). In such a general framework, these computable problems are hard. To be convinced, it is sufficient to consider the peculiar case where the used compact representation of preferences is the Pareto-based multicriteria one. Hence, the membership problem associated with this multiobjective spanning trees problem is NP-complete [6, 12]."

      "text" : "In Constraint Programming [19], consistency is a part of a more general problematic called description. The aim of consistency is the description of the feasible set of a constraint system by way of values or combinations of values belonging to at least one feasible element.\nConsistency problematic can be extended, in the framework of combinatorial problems exploiting non-conventional preferences, so as to take into account of preferential information. Simply, consistency will not rely on feasibility but on best quality or best compromise. Hence, we won’t remove inconsistent values in the meaning that they belong to no feasible solution, but rather because they belong to no preferred solution. In this case, we speak about preferential consistency. Without going into details, problems consisting in erasing preferentially inconsistent values, from a constraint system and a compact representation of a preference relation, are called preferential consistency problems. As in constraint satisfaction, several levels of preferential consistency can be defined, according to whether all or a part of preferentially inconsistent information is deleted. We named global preferential consistency the removing of all the preferentially inconsistent information.\nRemark 2. In a non-conventional preference context, each used choice axiom (e.g. optimality, maximality, domination, …) identifies a specific choice set (optimal set, maximal set, domination set, …) which are generally pairwise different (see § 2.1). This other parameter specializes preferential consistency. Thus, we speak about OPT-consistency for preferential consistency using optimality as choice axiom, MAX-consistency for preferential consistency using maximality, and so on.\nTo better understand preferential consistency, in the following, we study in details the case of maximal spanning tree problem. Consider then the following general computable problem, of preferential consistency for maximal spanning trees of a graph:\nGPC(ST/CBPR/MAX): Given an undirected graph G = (V, E) and a compact representation I(≽) of a preference relation ≽ on P(E), list the edges in E belonging to a maximal spanning tree for ≽, if such edges exist. Otherwise return ‘no’.\nAn edge e is called MAX-consistent for (G, I(≽)) if there exists at least one maximal spanning tree for (SST(G), ≽) containing e. Otherwise, it is called MAX-inconsistent for (G, I(≽)).\nIn this article, we do not dwell on the computational complexity of this problem. But there are great chances it is at least as difficult as ST/CBPR/MAX, with the sight of investigations in constraint programming [2, 19]. Yet, in order to better appreciate the using of this kind of computable problem in a DSS, we turn towards an efficiently solvable sub-problem of ST/CBPR/MAX."

The classical problem of maximum spanning tree (⇔ ST/Σu/OPT) can be polynomially transformed into the ST/TOSORTVSMAX/MAX problem. Indeed, for any spanning tree x of G, the sum of utilities of edges in x defines a total preorder ≽u on P(E):\n∀ (x, y) ∈ P(E)², x ≽u y ⇔ ∑ e∈x ue≥∑ e∈ y ue \nThe relation ≽u is TOSORT-VSMAX, and its compact representation ≽uE is the preorder induced by u: ∀ e, e’ ∈ E, e ≽uE e’ ⇔ u(e) ≥ u(e’). The couple (G, ≽uE) is then an instance of ST/TOSORT-VSMAX/MAX, and its solution set SST/TV/MAX(G, ≽uE) = B(SST(G), ≽u). This assertion is easily provable by erasing the topological sorting part of the sketch of proof of Theorem 1.\nThe ST/TOSORT-VSMAX/MAX problem can be used to model and solve multicriteria problems. So, the multi-attribute utility function can be aggregated first to produce global preferences on the edges, and next to partially rank sets of edges. Here is an example:\nExample 4. The ST/PARETO>TOSORT-VSMAX/MAX problem considers an undirected graph G = (V, E) and a couple (p, u) made up a positive number p and a multi-attribute utility function u from E × {1, ..., p} to ℝ. p is the number of considered criteria and u(e, k) is the utility of the edge e according to the criterion k. In this problem, the preference information (p, u) is aggregated with Pareto dominance, in order to define a global preference relation ≽EP on each edge:\n∀ e, e’ ∈ E, e ≽EP e’ ⇔ for every 1 ≤ k ≤ p, u(e, k) ≥ u(e’, k) Next, this preference relation on the edges is aggregated with the ≽K relation, to obtain a collective opinion ≽PK between the subsets of E.\nThen we consider the instance (G, (2, u)) made up the undirected graph G = (V, E) of the Figure 3, and the bicriteria utility function u given by the following table:\nBy aggregating u with the Pareto dominance, we obtain the preference relation ≽EP on E given by the Figure 5. At last, by solving the ST/TOSORT-VSMAX/MAX problem on this instance (G, ≽EP), we get the maximal set M(SST(G), ≽PK) = {abd, abh, acd, ach, bcd, bch}\nRemark 4. Instead of using the Pareto dominance to obtain the global preference relation ≽EP on the edges, we can apply any aggregation rule AR on u. The only condition on AR is to provide a preference relation ≽EP having at least the P-acyclicity property.\nIn the multicriteria decision-making community [10], the multiattribute utility function u(e, k), with (e, k) ∈ E × {1, ..., p}, is usually aggregated with a simple sum per criterion, to produce a family of p individual utilities on the powerset of edges. Next, this family is aggregated, generally with the Pareto dominance, into a global preference, noted in this case ≽\nΣP , on the sets of edges.\nExample 5. By running an algorithm solving the ST/pΣu>PARETO/ MAX problem on the instance (G, (2, u)) described in the Example 4, we obtain the maximal set M(SST(G), ≽ΣP) = {abh, acd, ach, bcd, bch}, which is strictly included in M(SST(G), ≽PK).\nThe following theorem describes the relationship between the classical hierarchical aggregation pΣu>PARETO and ours PARETO>TOSORT-VSMAX:\nTheorem 2. Given an undirected graph G = (V, E), and a couple (p, u) made up a positive number p and a multi-attribute utility function u from E × {1, ..., p} to ℝ; then every maximal solution for ST/pΣu>PARETO/MAX is also a maximal solution for ST/PARETO>TOSORTVSMAX/MAX. Formally:\n∀ x ∈ SST(G), x ∈ M(SST(G), ≽ΣP) ⇒ x ∈ M(SST(G), ≽PK) (1)\nBefore showing this theorem, here is a lemma which describes a property of the relation ≽K:\nLemma 1. Given a couple (G = (V, E), ≽E) and an element x ∈ P(E), then the relation ≽K is transitive and: ∃ y ∈ P(E) such that x ≽K y ⇔ x is optimal in (P(E), ≽K) ⇔ x is maximal in (P(E), ≽K) Moreover, if x ∈ SST(G), then: ∃ y ∈ SST(G) such that x ≽K y ⇔ x is optimal in (SST(G), ≽K)\n⇔ x is maximal in (SST(G), ≽K)\nProof: The demonstration of the optimality (first equivalence) is immediate. What about maximality (second equivalence)? If x is optimal, then x is maximal. Now, what about the contrary case ? If x is maximal in (P(E), ≽K) then, there 2 cases: If there exists a z such that x ≽K y, then x is optimal according to the first equivalence. Otherwise (⇔ if such a z does not exist), then ∀ w ∈ P(E), x ∥K w ⇔ ∀ w ∈ P(E), not(x ≽K w) and not(w ≽K x). Consequently, there is no optimal element in (P(E), ≽K). This assertion is equivalent to say that for every linear extension {e1, …, e|E|} of ≽E on E, and for every subset z of E, there exists a 1 ≤ j ≤ |E| verifying that: ej ∉ x and (x ∩ {e1, …, ej–1}) ∪ {ej} is acyclic. This is possible, if and only if (V, E) is a tree and E is not in P(E). This is a contradiction.\nHence, at last, x is optimal in (P(E), ≽K) ⇔ x is maximal in (P(E), ≽K). The transitivity of ≽K is a direct consequence of the first equivalence. Next, both the last equivalences are true because (P(E), ≽K) verifies the Arrow choice axiom [23]: For any A, B ∈ P(E) and A ⊆ B,\nIf B(B, ≽K) ∩ A ≠ ∅ then B(B, ≽K) ∩ A = B(A, ≽K) (every restriction of P(E) conserves the optimality). \nProof (Theorem 2): First of all, both the following assertions are false: (a) ∀ x, y ∈ SST(G), x ≽PK y ⇒ x ≽ΣP y (b) ∀ x, y ∈ SST(G), x ≽ΣP y ⇒ x ≽PK y\nIndeed, for the assertion (a), it is sufficient to take the undirected graph of Figure 3, with the bicriteria utility function of Table 1.\nThe assertion (b) is false because PK only carries out the dichotomy between the maximal set and its complementary. So, the preferences between two non maximal elements are unknown.\nWe prove now the formulae (1). So, we reason by contradiction: Suppose there exists an x ∈ SST(G) maximal for ≽ΣP, but not for ≽PK. This proposition is equivalent with the following one, according to Lemma 1: ∃ x ∈ SST(G) such that: [∀ y ∈ SST(G), not(y ≻ΣP x)] and [∀ y ∈ SST(G), not(x ≽PK y)] By definition, not(x ≽PK y) ⇔ ∃ e1 ∈ E \\ x, and ∃ e2 ∈ L(x ∪ {e1}) verifying e1 ≻EP e2. Now, if we take the spanning tree y defined as follow: y = x ∪ {e1} \\ {e2}, then we have, because of the definition of e1 ≻EP e2:\n∀ 1 ≤ i ≤ p, ),(),(),(),( 2 }{\\ 1 }{\\ 11 ieuieuieuieu exeexe +≤+ ∑∑ ∈∈ , and\n∃ 1 ≤ k ≤ p, ),(),(),(),( 2 }{\\ 1 }{\\ 11 keukeukeukeu exeexe +<+ ∑∑ ∈∈ .\n⇔ y ≻ΣP x. This contradicts the maximality of x in (SST(G), ≽ΣP). Hence the result. \nIn the following, we propose an algorithm solving: GPC(ST/TOSORT-VSMAX/MAX), the global preferential consistency problem associated with ST/TOSORT-VSMAX/MAX."

(b) for all x ∈ SST/TV/MAX(G, ≽E) ⊆ P(E), x ⊆ SGPC(ST/TV/MAX)(G, ≽E).\nThe Figure 6 presents an algorithm solving this preferential consistency problem.\nThis algorithm supposes we know: − Another algorithm NBCONNECTEDCOMPONENTS solving the counting\nproblem of the connected components in an undirected graph. This problem is known solvable in a linear time (by a depth first search algorithm) for any given undirected graph (see e.g. [22, § 6.3 p. 90]). − A choice strategy CHOOSE outputting an element of the input explicit set in the non-empty case. Otherwise, return ‘no’.\nExample 6. By running GPCORDINALSTMAX1 on the instance given in Figure 1 and Figure 3, we obtain as result the respective edges sets {a, b} and E \\ {b}.\nWe denote |(G, ≽E)| the size of the instance (G, ≽E) of ST/TOSORT-VSMAX/MAX. This size can be formulated in terms of the vertices set cardinality m = |V| of graph G, the number of edges n = |E| in G, and the number of arcs p = |≽E| in (E, ≽E): Hence, |(G, ≽E)| is in O(m + n + p). Now, we remark that 0 ≤ n ≤ m² and 0 ≤ p ≤ n². Hence, |(G, ≽E)| is in O(m4). We have the following results:\nProperty 2. The algorithm GPCORDINALSTMAX1 has a worst case time complexity, which is linear in the size of the input (G, ≽E).\nProof: It is simply sufficient to see that an order of magnitude for the worst case time complexity of this algorithm GPCORDINALSTMAX1 only depends on the second loop (lines 5 to 10). The algorithm\nNBCONNECTEDCOMPONENTS , solving the counting connected components problem in time linear in the size of its instance (a partial graph of G), is then in O(m + n). Consequently, the worst case time complexity of the conditional instruction ‘if …end if’ (line 9) is about m + n. It is similar for: − line 6, where the choice strategy necessitates a greedy search of\nmaximal edge, solvable in the worst case in O(n) − line 8, where the maximum number of possible unions is about\ncardinality of E, i.e. in O(n). At last, the body of the 2nd loop runs in the worst case in O(m + n) times. Now, the number of loops is equal to the number of edges; and proves that the complexity of the algorithm GPCORDINALSTMAX1 is in O((m + n)⋅n) ≈ O(m4), i.e. linear in the input size |(G, ≽E)|. \nTheorem 3 The algorithm GPCORDINALSTMAX1 returns the whole MAX-consistent edges (and only them) for maximal spanning trees of the ST/TOSORT-VSMAX/MAX problem, from an instance ((V, E), ≽E), if such trees exist. Otherwise returns ‘no’.\nThe logic underlying this algorithm consists in putting an edge e ∈ E in a best scenario of choice, in order to elaborate a linear extension of ≽E (= the minimal number assigned to e among the linear extensions). Such a best scenario consists in choosing e as soon as possible, during the topological sort. For that, the topological sorting algorithm has to number every better edge e’ than e for ≽E; next the edge e’ is numbered iff every better edge than e’ is numbered, and so on. In the best case, when e is numbered, if the number of connected components decreases when we add e to the already numbered edges, then e can be chosen to belong to a maximal spanning tree for a TOSORT-VSMAX preference relation. Indeed, this best scenario may then be completed in a maximal spanning tree, by iteratively choosing any maximal remaining edge.\nBefore showing this theorem, here is a lemma which will help us in the demonstration.\nLemma 2. Given an instance (G, ≽E), with ≽E P-acyclic, denote C(e) the edges of E for which there exists a path of strict preferences towards e: C(e) = {f ∈ E such that: ∃ f (1), …, f (p) ∈ E, with p ≥ 0, and f ≻E f (1) ≻E … ≻E f (p) ≻E e}. Then, for every A ⊆ E, C(e) \\ A ≠ ∅ ⇒ M(C(e) \\ A, ≽E) ⊆ M(E \\ A,≽E)\nProof: First of all, let us clarify the set E \\ C(e): E \\ C(e) = {f ∈ E such that: There exists no path of strict prefer-\nences from f to e in (E, ≽E)} = {f ∈ E such that: There is no path of strict preferences\nfrom f to e1 in (E, ≽E), ∀ e1 ∈ C(e)}. Indeed, if such a path existed from f to e1, and – by definition of C(e) – from e1 to e, then there would exist a path of strict preferences from f to e.\nShow now lemma: Suppose that C(e) \\ A ≠ ∅. Then every edge f ∈ M(C(e) \\ A, ≽E) verifies: ∀ f1 ∈ C(e) \\ A, not(f1 ≻E f)\n⇒ There exists no path of strict preferences from f1 to f in (C(e) \\ A, ≽E).\nHence, if some edges are added to C(e) \\ A – in this case E \\ (C(e) ∪ A) – for which there exists no path of strict preferences from f2 ∈ E \\ (C(e) ∪ A) to e1 ∈ C(e) \\ A, then it won’t also exist a path from f2 to f. At last, ∀ f ∈ M(C(e) \\ A, ≽E), ∀ f1 ∈ E \\ A, not(f1 ≻E f). This shows lemma. \nProof (Theorem 3): Firstly, we have the following equivalence, because of the Properties 1 (b) translated by the first line of the algorithm: GPCORDINALSTMAX1(G, ≽E) = ‘no’ ⇔ SST(G) = ∅. Then point out on the first part of the proposition: Suppose GPCORDINALSTMAX1(G, ≽E) ≠ ‘no’, and show – by help of Lemma 2 – formulae (2):\nGPCORDINALSTMAX1(G, ≽E) =  ),(ST/TV/MAX EGSx x ≥∈ .\nDirect inclusion: For any e ∈ GPCORDINALSTMAX1(G, ≽E) ⊆ E, there exists x ∈ SST/TV/MAX(G, ≽E) ⊆ P(E), such that: e ∈ x. Indeed, such an x can be designed by using the strategy described in the previous remark with a topological sort of (E, ≽E). So, as long as we are not at an iteration k such that e is maximal in the set Bk of not yet numbered edges, then, during iterations i < k, the choice strategy consists in taking as current edge ei a maximal edge for (C(e) \\ (E \\ Bi), ≽E), with C(e) \\ (E \\ Bi) ⊆ Bi. According to the above lemma, M(C(e) \\ (E \\ Bi), ≽E) ⊆ M(Bi,≽E). Therefore, this strategy is available, and the iteration k = |C(e)|. During the iteration k, given e decreases the number of connected components in C(e) – because e is in GPCORDINALSTMAX1(G, ≽E) and then verifies the condition of line 9 in GPCORDINALSTMAX1 –, then e is chosen to be added to Ak–1, the current tree. Next, during iterations i > k, the topological sort algorithm takes as current edge, any edge of M(Bi,≽E). At last, the elaborated linear extension can be associated to a utility function (see sketch of proof of Theorem 1) and next used as instance of an algorithm solving ST/Σu/OPT, which necessarily returns a solution x ≠ ‘non’, containing e and then maximal for (G, ≽E).\nConverse inclusion: For every x ∈ SST/TV/MAX(G, ≽E) ⊆ P(E), x ⊆ SGPC(ST/TV/MAX)(G, ≽E). Indeed, reason by contradiction. Suppose that:\n∃ x ∈ SST/TV/MAX(G, ≽E) and x ⊄ SGPC(ST/TV/MAX)(G, ≽E). ⇔ ∃ e ∉ SGPC(ST/TV/MAX)(G, ≽E) although: e ∈ x, and x ∈\nSST/TV/MAX(G, ≽E). ⇔ The number of connected components does not decrease if we\nadd e in C(e), according to line 9 of GPCORDINALSTMAX1 ⇔ Τhere exists in C(e) an undirected path L(e) between both the\nends of e.\nSo that e should be chosen during the design of x, because e ∈ x, it is necessary that e be maximal at an iteration k ≤ |E|, if we use the Kruskal’s algorithm to solve ST/TO-SORT-VSMAX/MAX. At this iteration, e ∈ Ak, the tree at iteration k, and e decreases the number of connected components in Ak–1. If e ∈ M(E, ≽E), then e ∈ SGPC(ST/TV/MAX)(G, ≽E), this is a contradiction with the initial assumption. Accordingly, C(e) ≠ ∅. Moreover, every edge of C(e) has already been chosen in the scenario of the topological sort algorithm during iterations i < k, in order that e be maximal during the iteration k. It is sure that C(e) ⊈ x because it would exist an undirected path L(e) ∪ {e} in x; that is contradictory with x is a tree. Hence C(e) \\ x ≠ ∅. And for every f ∈ C(e) \\ x, f has not been added to x because during the iteration i < k where it has been chosen, there already exists an undirected path L(f) in Ai ⊆ x between the ends of f.\nNow, the edge set (C(e) ∩ x) ∪         ∈  xeCf fL \\)( )( is an undirected\npath (or contains such a path) in x between the ends of e, making up with e an undirected path in x (see Figure 7). This contradicts the assumption x is a tree. That demonstrates the converse inclusion. "

      "heading" : "6 CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES",
      "text" : "One of the limits, devolved upon decision processes based on listing of preferred solutions suggested by Perny & Spanjaard [18] to solve ordinal combinatorial problems, was the intractability of large size inputs. We introduced another kind of computable problems, preferential consistency ones. Their outputs can be processed in real-time by a human being (i.e. linear in the input size). These computable problems are based both on the notion of consistency pointing out by constraint programming (CP), and on the notion of choice investigated in decision aiding (DA). In the case of maximal spanning trees problems satisfying the TOSORT-VSMAX condition, we proposed an algorithm solving the global consistency problem, with a linear worst case time complexity in its input size.\nOne of the aims of this article is to bring together the CP and OR-DA communities, to process more efficiently combinatorial problems exploiting complex preferences. Their mutual contributions open a new way of interactive solving of semi-structured combinatorial problems. Consequently, the perspectives are numerous: At first, with preferential consistency: Global preferential consistency can be used in an interactive decision process, where the user makes some local decisions (choice), and where the DSS is restricted to remove preferential inconsistent domain-values. However, such support systems may not always warrant a preferred solution for the initial instance. Consequently, we have explored this way, for example by identifying domain-values which are in all preferred solutions or, by investigating rational choice theory [23] to identify some sufficient properties so that the decision process always returns a preferred solution for the initial instance, if such a solution exists. Next, with efficient spanning trees problems and the particular compact representation of preferences used in this article: We have been scrutinizing the concept of expressive power of a compact representation. Any kind of compact representations models only a subset of preference relations. For example, utility functions model\nonly total preorders. In order to better understand the type of compact representation used in this article, we focus our researches on its expressive power for spanning trees problems. At last, with applications: What makes a good theory, it is its applicability to real world problems. The possible applications are numerous. And at this time, we work on an autonomous electrical network designing problem allowing several – not necessary cardinal – criteria. Shortly, these problems arise in isolated regions as some Pacific islands or in remote villages in rainforest. The isolation of these populations implies that the continuous supply of fossil fuels is very expensive to the community, and exorbitantly expensive if you wanted to connect to an existing electricity grid. Renewable energies form a more interesting both in terms of costs (a barrel of oil more and more expensive, and means of delivery prohibitive as boat (sometimes pirogue), helicopter or plane), in terms of noise and soil pollution, etc. These problems necessitate very complex preferential information as inhabitants opinions, cost, environmental and aesthetic criteria."
