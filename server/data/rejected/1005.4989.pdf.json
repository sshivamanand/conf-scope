      "text" : "A Formalization of the Turing Test\nEvgeny Chutchev\n1. Introduction\nThe Turing test was described by A. Turing in his paper [4] as follows: An interrogator questions both Turing machine and second participant of the test (a person), each of which tries to appear human. The interrogator does not know from whom exactly he receives answers and has the objective to tell the Turing machine from the person (for more details, see, for example, [3]). In this paper, we consider a formalization of the Turing test and obtain the following results (Figure 1.1):\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives definitions and introduces notations. Section 3 considers tests with arbitrary Turing machines. Section 4 considers tests with Turing machines of some special classes. Section 5 considers the strict Turing test. Section 6 presents the conclusion. Section 7 contains a list of definitions and notations. Section 8 contains references. Section 9 is an appendix, where we consider a random answers model for the second\nparticipant of the test that does not follow an algorithm.\n2. General definitions and notations\n2.1. Words and numbers 1. Suppose \uD835\uDD38 is a finite alphabet and symbol θ does not belong to \uD835\uDD38. By \uD835\uDD38∗ denote all words over \uD835\uDD38, including the empty word λ. By λ\uD835\uDC5B denote the sequence of \uD835\uDC5B empty words λ. 2. Denote by ℕ the set of all natural numbers (excluding zero), and put ℕ0 ≝ ℕ∪ {0}. We will not make any distinction between the elements of ℕ0 and their notations over the alphabet \uD835\uDD38, assuming ℕ0 = \uD835\uDD38\n∗\\*λ+. 3. Fix some letter \uD835\uDC4E ∈ \uD835\uDD38, and for each word ω ∈ \uD835\uDD38∗ denote by ω the word \uD835\uDC4Eω.\n2\n4. Put \uD835\uDD39 ≝ \uD835\uDD38 ∪ {}.\n2.2. Turing machines 1. We assume that:\n Turing machine (TM) starts on the work tape that contains a finite string of symbols, which may be blank.\n TM has several final states; some of them may be marked with “Left” or “Right”.  Along with conventional work head, TM has three additional heads and three tapes\neach of which has a leftmost cell but is infinite to the right. We name these additional heads as the oracle interface, the input and the output of TM,\nconsidering that the oracle interface and the input can only read out symbols from \uD835\uDD39, and the output can only print symbols from \uD835\uDD39, while θ stands for the blank symbol. The tape of the oracle interface is blank (we shall use it for oracle TM; see Item 2.4.1 below), and both input and output tapes are replaced with new tapes when TM starts up or when TM is transferred to the initial state.\n2. Denote by \uD835\uDD44 the set of all TMs that we have described. We shall not distinguish between TMs and their descriptions (in the form of the words over \uD835\uDD38) suitable for realization on the universal TM.\n3. Let us consider the functioning of TM as an exchange of questions and answers. A question is sent to TM only when it is in the initial state or in the final state (in the latter case, TM is moved to the initial state, but the content of the work tape does not change). The question is a word over \uD835\uDD39 recorded at the beginning of the new input tape. After installation of the input tape, TM starts up, and if TM halts, the maximum length word over \uD835\uDD38, placed at the beginning of the output tape, is the answer to the question (thus the answer may be equal to λ).\n4. We say that:  TM \uD835\uDD10 answers the questions 1,… ,\uD835\uDC5B if \uD835\uDD10 calculates those answers in a finite number\nof cycles. In the specified case denote by \uD835\uDD10 1,… ,\uD835\uDC5B the answer of \uD835\uDD10 to the last question \uD835\uDC5B ; denote the reverse case by the formal equation \uD835\uDD10 1,… ,\uD835\uDC5B = ∞ 1.  TM \uD835\uDD10 recognizes TM \uD835\uDD11 if \uD835\uDD10 answers the question \uD835\uDD11.  TM \uD835\uDD10 is communicable if \uD835\uDD10 answers any sequence of questions, each of which belongs\nto \uD835\uDD38∗.  TM \uD835\uDD10 is autonomous if the answers of \uD835\uDD10 do not depend on the content of the\nquestions.  TM \uD835\uDD10 is the generator if \uD835\uDD10 is simultaneously communicable and autonomous.\nDenote by ℂ the set of all communicable TMs. For generator ℌ and \uD835\uDC5B ∈ ℕ put ℌ,\uD835\uDC5B- ≝ ℌ 1,… , \uD835\uDC5B , where 1,… ,\uD835\uDC5B are some questions.\n5. Assign to each TM \uD835\uDD10 the generator \uD835\uDD10 that operates under the following principle: For\neach \uD835\uDC5B ∈ ℕ, put \uD835\uDD10,\uD835\uDC5B- ≝ , if \uD835\uDD10(\uD835\uDC5B) = ∞,\n\uD835\uDD10(\uD835\uDC5B) in another case.\n6. We call TM ℰ the enumerator if ∀\uD835\uDC5B∈ℕ(ℰ(\uD835\uDC5B) ∈ \uD835\uDD44).\n7. For every enumerator ℰ, put ℰ*\uD835\uDC41+ ≝ {ℰ(\uD835\uDC5B): \uD835\uDC5B = 1,… ,\uD835\uDC41}. Fix the enumerator \uD835\uDC9C that enumerates all TMs: \uD835\uDC9C*∞+ = \uD835\uDD44. Put \uD835\uDD04\uD835\uDC58 ≝ \uD835\uDC9C(\uD835\uDC58).\n8. Assign to every enumerator ℰ that enumerates some communicable TMs (ℰ*∞+ ⊆ ℂ) the\ngenerator ℰ that is constructed by analogy with Cantor's diagonal method: ℰ,\uD835\uDC5B- ≝ ℰ(\uD835\uDC5B)(\uD835\uDC5B).\n1 Assuming ∞ ∉ \uD835\uDD38.\n3\n2.3. Oracles 1. Denote by oracle the content of the oracle interface tape, the cells on which contain symbols from \uD835\uDD39. 2. Denote by \uD835\uDEF1 the oracle that contains the lexicographic ordered notations \uD835\uDD10\uD835\uDD11 for all TMs \uD835\uDD10 and \uD835\uDD11 such that \uD835\uDD10 recognizes \uD835\uDD11. 3. Denote by \uD835\uDEE9 the blank oracle.\n2.4. Oracle Turing machines 1. We shall understand the construction from Item 2.2.1, where the oracle interface tape may be non-blank, as oracle Turing machine (OTM). Denote OTM by \uD835\uDD10\uD835\uDEF7 , where \uD835\uDD10 is TM and \uD835\uDEF7 is oracle (thus \uD835\uDD10\uD835\uDEE9 = \uD835\uDD10).\n2. Extending the concepts from Items 2.2.3 and 2.2.4 to OTMs, we call OTMs \uD835\uDC48 and \uD835\uDC49 as \uD835\uDC41-similar if for every \uD835\uDC5B ≤ \uD835\uDC41 and for any questions β = 1,… ,\uD835\uDC5B the equality \uD835\uDC48() = \uD835\uDC49() holds. Two OTMs \uD835\uDC48 and \uD835\uDC49, which are \uD835\uDC41-similar for every \uD835\uDC41 ∈ ℕ, we call similar and denote this by \uD835\uDC48 ≈ \uD835\uDC49. 3. We say that OTM \uD835\uDC44 reduces to TM \uD835\uDD10 if \uD835\uDC44 ≈ \uD835\uDD10. Denote the type of OTM by notation ≻\uD835\uDD44 if OTM reduces to some TM and in another case use the notation ⊁\uD835\uDD44.\n2.5. Testers 1. Any pair \uD835\uDC3C,\uD835\uDC44 , where \uD835\uDC3C and \uD835\uDC44 are OTMs, we call the tester. For the specified tester we call \uD835\uDC3C the interrogator, and \uD835\uDC44 the second participant (SP). 2. Denote the tester type by notation (type of interrogator, type of SP). 3. We say that interrogator is dumb if its answer to any consequence of questions is .\n2.6. Tests 1. Consider tester \uD835\uDC47 = \uD835\uDC3C,\uD835\uDC44 and TM \uD835\uDD10 and define the following procedure as the left (the right) test:  At the beginning of the test, the question  enters the interrogator \uD835\uDC3C input.  Each answer of interrogator serves as the question for both \uD835\uDC44 and \uD835\uDD10 (we call such a\nquestion the test question).  The question α\uD835\uDC44α\uD835\uDD10 (or the question α\uD835\uDD10α\uD835\uDC44 for the right test), where α\uD835\uDC44 and α\uD835\uDD10 are\nthe answers of \uD835\uDC44 and \uD835\uDD10 to the last test question, enters \uD835\uDC3C input. We interpret this as receiving the first test answer from the “left” subject of the test, and receiving the second test answer from the “right” one.\n Whenever \uD835\uDC3C has reached the final state marked with “Left” (“Right”), the test is finished and the result of the test is “SP is on the left” (“SP is on the right”). Denote by ,\uD835\uDC47,\uD835\uDD10, ℓ- (by ,\uD835\uDC47,\uD835\uDD10,\uD835\uDCC7-) the left (the right) test described above and denote\nby ,\uD835\uDC47,\uD835\uDD10,∗- any of these tests. 2. We say that:\n TM \uD835\uDD10 fails the left test , \uD835\uDC3C,\uD835\uDC44 ,\uD835\uDD10, ℓ- (the right test , \uD835\uDC3C, \uD835\uDC44 ,\uD835\uDD10,\uD835\uDCC7-) if either \uD835\uDD10 does not answer some test question that SP \uD835\uDC44 has answered or if this test is finished with the correct result.  TM fails the test ,\uD835\uDC47,\uD835\uDD10- if it fails both the left test ,\uD835\uDC47,\uD835\uDD10, ℓ- and the right test ,\uD835\uDC47, \uD835\uDD10,\uD835\uDCC7-2. The statement that TM \uD835\uDD10 fails the test ,\uD835\uDC47,\uD835\uDD10- we denote in short by \uD835\uDD10 ⋫ \uD835\uDC47; the\nconverse statement we denote by \uD835\uDD10 ⊳ \uD835\uDC47. 3. We say that tester \uD835\uDC47 is successful for a given set \uD835\uDD43 ⊆ \uD835\uDD44 if ∀\uD835\uDD10∈\uD835\uDD43(\uD835\uDD10 ⋫ \uD835\uDC47). 4. Assign to each SP \uD835\uDD14 ∈ \uD835\uDD44 the dumb interrogator ℑ\uD835\uDD14 ∈ \uD835\uDD44 who completes the test ℑ\uD835\uDD14 \uD835\uDEF7 ,\uD835\uDD14 ,\uD835\uDD10,∗ for any oracle \uD835\uDEF7 only in the case when the test answers from \uD835\uDD14 and \uD835\uDD10 are different, and in this case ℑ\uD835\uDD14 \uD835\uDEF7 calculates α = \uD835\uDD14(\uD835\uDC5B), where \uD835\uDC5B is a number of the current test step, and indicates the location of SP as the source of reply α. Note that ℑ\uD835\uDD14 \uD835\uDEF7 performs operations that do not depend on \uD835\uDEF7.\nPut \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDD14 \uD835\uDEF7 ≝ ℑ\uD835\uDD14 \uD835\uDEF7 ,\uD835\uDD14 and \uD835\uDD4B\uD835\uDEF7 ≝ \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDD14 \uD835\uDEF7 :\uD835\uDD14 ∈ \uD835\uDD44 .\n2.7. Comments 1. The handling of every question by certain TM with the input head and the output head can be described as the functioning of an arbitrary TM with only one head and with initial content of the\n2 See also the strict test in Section 5.\n4\nwork tape equal to the question (see [2]). Then note that in accordance with § 42 [1], there is an elementary arithmetic formula \uD835\uDCBB(\uD835\uDC65,\uD835\uDC66) with free occurrence of variables \uD835\uDC65 and \uD835\uDC66, which is true for \uD835\uDC65 ∈ \uD835\uDD44 and \uD835\uDC66 ∈ \uD835\uDD44 if and only if \uD835\uDC65 and \uD835\uDC66 are on the tape \uD835\uDEF1.\n2. We consider SP as the tester constituent and explain this as follows. The original description of the test offered by A. Turing assumes the loyalty of SP to interrogator. Now if interrogator gives in his zero numbered test question the instructions on how SP should operate (for example, instructions in the form \uD835\uDD10\uD835\uDCBB for OTM \uD835\uDD10\uD835\uDEF1), then SP, due to his loyalty, will fulfill these instructions. The instructions to simulate the OTM equipped with computable oracle are executable by a human. The problem of simulation of OTM equipped with non-computable oracle is beyond the scope of this paper.\n3. Tests with arbitrary Turing machines\nWe shall consider tests under various conditions of reducibility of interrogator and SP to TM (Theorems 3.1 and 3.2) and prove at first the following lemma.\nLEMMA 3.1. 1. For each enumerator ℰ that enumerates some communicable TMs3 and for each oracle \uD835\uDEF7,\nthe tester \uD835\uDC47 ℰ \uD835\uDEF7 is successful for ℰ*∞+.\n2. Tester \uD835\uDC47 ℰ \uD835\uDEF7 will finish the test \uD835\uDF0F = \uD835\uDC47 ℰ \uD835\uDEF7 ,ℰ(\uD835\uDC5B),∗ not later than at the \uD835\uDC5Bth step.\nPROOF. The interrogator ℑℰ \uD835\uDEF7 is mute, and due to inequality ℰ,\uD835\uDC5B- ≠ ℰ(\uD835\uDC5B) (λ\uD835\uDC5B), this\ninterrogator successfully completes the test \uD835\uDF0F not later than at the \uD835\uDC5Bth step. □\nTHEOREM 3.1. 1. For each tester with SP that reduces to TM, the specified TM can pass the test; hence,\nany such tester is not successful for \uD835\uDD44 4.\n2. For each tester T of the type (≻\uD835\uDD44, ≻\uD835\uDD44), some generator ℌ can pass the test ,\uD835\uDC47,ℌ-. 3. The problem of constructing the generator ℌ that can pass the test , ℑ,\uD835\uDD14 ,ℌ-, where ℑ\nand \uD835\uDD14 are arbitrary TMs, is algorithmically unsolvable.\nPROOF. The proof of Item 1 of the theorem arises from the definition of TM’s ability to pass the test.\nTo prove Item 2 of the theorem consider ℌ = \uD835\uDD10 , where TM \uD835\uDD10 is defined as follows: If \uD835\uDD0D and \uD835\uDD14 are TMs, to which interrogator and SP are reduced, then \uD835\uDD10 is an autonomous TM that simulates , ℑ,\uD835\uDD14 ,\uD835\uDD14,∗- and gives the answers that are the same as those of \uD835\uDD14 in this test. In order to prove Item 3 of the theorem assume that there exists TM \uD835\uDD05 such that generator ℌ = \uD835\uDD05(ℑθ\uD835\uDD14) can pass the test , ℑ,\uD835\uDD14 ,ℌ-. Then consider the following enumerator ℰ that\nenumerates generators: ℰ(\uD835\uDC5B) ≝ \uD835\uDD05 ℑ\uD835\uDD04\uD835\uDC5Bθ\uD835\uDD04\uD835\uDC5B . According to the definition of ℰ, we have ∀\uD835\uDC5B∈ℕ ℰ(\uD835\uDC5B) ⊳ \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDD04\uD835\uDC5B \uD835\uDEE9 and thus ∀\uD835\uDC47∈\uD835\uDD4B\uD835\uDEE9∃\uD835\uDC5B(ℰ(\uD835\uDC5B) ⊳ \uD835\uDC47). But Item 1 of Lemma 3.1 implies that ∃\uD835\uDC47∈\uD835\uDD4B\uD835\uDEE9∀\uD835\uDC5B(ℰ(\uD835\uDC5B) ⋫ \uD835\uDC47). □\nTHEOREM 3.2. Some tester of the type (≻\uD835\uDD44, ⊁\uD835\uDD44) with dumb interrogator is successful\nfor \uD835\uDD44.\nPROOF5. Let us describe the desired tester \uD835\uDC47 = \uD835\uDC3C,\uD835\uDC44 , where \uD835\uDC44 is equipped with oracle \uD835\uDEF1: SP \uD835\uDC44, after receiving the \uD835\uDC5Bth test question, acts as follows:  \uD835\uDC44 calculates \uD835\uDD04\uD835\uDC5B and queries its oracle \uD835\uDEF1 whether \uD835\uDD04\uD835\uDC5B recognizes itself.  If the oracle answers in the affirmative, \uD835\uDC44 simulates the work of \uD835\uDD04\uD835\uDC5B with question \uD835\uDD04\uD835\uDC5B ,\ncalculates the number \uD835\uDC61 of cycles that is necessary for \uD835\uDD04\uD835\uDC5B to compute \uD835\uDD04\uD835\uDC5B(\uD835\uDD04\uD835\uDC5B), and gives the answer \uD835\uDC61.\n3 Note that if there is an enumerator ℰ that enumerates all communicable TMs, then ℰ*∞+ would\ninclude all generators, and then any generator would be similar to some element in ℛ*∞+,\nwhere ℛ(\uD835\uDC5B) ≝ ℰ(\uD835\uDC5B) , but ℛ ∉ ℛ*∞+. 4 Thus, for the successfulness of such tester either SP should not reduce to TM (see Theorem 3.2) or SP, which reduces to TM, should not belong to the class of TMs that are subjects of the test (see Section 4). 5 The idea of the proof is based on Subsection 3 of Section 6 of [4].\n5  If the oracle answers negative, \uD835\uDC44 gives the answer 0.\nInterrogator \uD835\uDC3C, after receiving the answers to the \uD835\uDC5Bth test question, follows the next procedure:\n If the answers are equal, \uD835\uDC3C continues the test.  Otherwise, \uD835\uDC3C treats each nonzero answer as a notation of some natural number \uD835\uDC61,\ncalculates \uD835\uDD04\uD835\uDC5B and verifies, whether \uD835\uDD04\uD835\uDC5B will answer the question \uD835\uDD04\uD835\uDC5B for \uD835\uDC61 cycles; at negative result of verification \uD835\uDC3C finishes the test, locating SP as the source of another answer.\nIf some TM \uD835\uDD11 passes the test ,\uD835\uDC47,\uD835\uDD11-, then the problem of recognition of TMs not recognizing themselves is solvable by \uD835\uDD11, but it is well known that this is impossible (see, for example, § 42 [1]). To complete the proof, note that reducibility of \uD835\uDC44 to TM contradicts Item 1 of Theorem 3.1. □\n4. Testing for special classes of Turing machines\nIn this section, we consider the tests for all communicable TMs, and the tests for communicable TMs with time or memory limitation (we can suppose that these TMs are close-to-reality models of computer programs).\n4.1. Testing for communicable Turing machines\nTHEOREM 4.1. 1. Any tester of the type (≻\uD835\uDD44, ≻\uD835\uDD44) is not successful for ℂ. 2. Some tester of the type (≻\uD835\uDD44, ⊁\uD835\uDD44) is successful for ℂ. 3. Some tester of the type (⊁\uD835\uDD44, ≻\uD835\uDD44) is successful for ℂ.\nPROOF. Items 1 and 2 of the theorem follow from Item 2 of Theorem 3.1 and from Theorem 3.2, respectively. To prove Item 3 of the theorem we shall describe the desired interrogator \uD835\uDC3C, which is equipped with oracle \uD835\uDEF1, and SP \uD835\uDD14 ∈ \uD835\uDD44. During the test \uD835\uDC3C makes use of parameter \uD835\uDC5F ∈ ℕ0, supposing \uD835\uDC5F = 0 at the beginning of the test. At the \uD835\uDC5Bth step of the test (\uD835\uDC5B ∈ ℕ) interrogator, by means of oracle \uD835\uDEF1, finds the minimal \uD835\uDC58\uD835\uDC5B > \uD835\uDC5F, at which:\n If \uD835\uDC5B = 1, then \uD835\uDD04\uD835\uDC58\uD835\uDC5B recognizes itself.  If \uD835\uDC5B > 1, then \uD835\uDD04\uD835\uDC58\uD835\uDC5B answers the questions µ1 , µ2 ,… , µ\uD835\uDC5B−1,\uD835\uDD04\uD835\uDC58\uD835\uDC5B , where µ1 , µ2 ,… , µ\uD835\uDC5B−1 are\nthe previous test questions (each of which belongs to \uD835\uDD44).\nThereafter \uD835\uDC3C assigns the value \uD835\uDC58\uD835\uDC5B to \uD835\uDC5F and puts the \uD835\uDC5Bth test question µ\uD835\uDC5B ≝ \uD835\uDD04\uD835\uDC58\uD835\uDC5B 6.\nSP \uD835\uDD14 gives the answer µ\uD835\uDC5B(µ1, µ2 ,… , µ\uD835\uDC5B) to the \uD835\uDC5Bth test question. For the first time when \uD835\uDC3C received two different answers, \uD835\uDC3C calculates the answer of \uD835\uDD14 and completes the test, locating \uD835\uDD14 as the source of its answer. Now consider the test , \uD835\uDC3C,\uD835\uDD14 ,ℭ- for arbitrary ℭ ∈ ℂ. The proof of the theorem follows from ℭ = \uD835\uDD04\uD835\uDC58\uD835\uDC5B for some \uD835\uDC5B, while the reducibility of \uD835\uDC3C to TM contradicts Item 1 of this theorem, which is already proved7. □\n4.2. Testing for Turing machines limited in time We say that communicable TM ℭ is limited in time if there is an upper bound for number of cycles required to calculate each following answer of ℭ .\nTHEOREM 4.2. Some tester of the type (≻\uD835\uDD44, ≻\uD835\uDD44) with dumb interrogator is successful for all communicable limited in time TMs.\nPROOF. For each TM \uD835\uDD10 and each \uD835\uDC61 ∈ ℕ denote by \uD835\uDD10 \uD835\uDC61 TM \uD835\uDD10 that operates under the control of special supervisor TM. The supervisor observes how \uD835\uDD10 processes with questions , and at the first time when \uD835\uDD10 has not provide an answer for \uD835\uDC61 work cycles, supervisor shuts down \uD835\uDD10 and gives  as the answer of \uD835\uDD10 \uD835\uDC61 to the current and all subsequent questions.\n6 Note that the interrogator's questions do not depend on the receiving answers. 7 Note that Item 1 of Theorem 3.1 implies that \uD835\uDD14 ∉ ℂ, and this is also clear from the principle of how \uD835\uDD14\nworks: If \uD835\uDD14 ∈ ℂ, then \uD835\uDD14(µ1, µ2 ,… , µ\uD835\uDC5B) = \uD835\uDD14(µ1 , µ2 ,… , µ\uD835\uDC5B) for some \uD835\uDC5B.\n6 Now construct an enumerator ℰ that enumerates \uD835\uDD10 \uD835\uDC61 for all \uD835\uDD10 ∈ \uD835\uDD44 and all \uD835\uDC61 ∈ ℕ. For\neach ℭ ∈ ℂ that is limited in time, an arbitrary TM in ℰ*∞+ is similar to ℭ , whereby the theorem statement follows from Item 1 of Lemma 3.1 8. □\n4.3. Testing for Turing machines limited in memory Consider a class of communicable TMs limited in memory, namely, TMs with a uniform upper bound for the number of states and a uniform upper bound for the length of the work tape segment that TM may scan in the processing of empty questions.\nTHEOREM 4.3. Some tester of the type (≻\uD835\uDD44, ≻\uD835\uDD44) with dumb interrogator is successful for all communicable limited in memory TMs.\nPROOF. We need the following definitions:  Denote by \uD835\uDD43 the set of all TMs that satisfy the specified limitation for the number of states and\nfor the length of the initial content of the work tape.  Denote by \uD835\uDD42 the set of all TMs from \uD835\uDD43 ∩ ℂ that satisfy the specified limitation for the length of\nthe work tape segment that TM makes use of in the processing of empty questions.\nNow calculate such \uD835\uDC41 that \uD835\uDD43 ⊆ \uD835\uDC9C*\uD835\uDC41+ and put \uD835\uDD43\uD835\uDC41 ≝ *\uD835\uDD10 ∈ \uD835\uDD43:\uD835\uDD10(λ \uD835\uDC41) ≠ ∞+ (note\nthat \uD835\uDD42 ⊆ \uD835\uDD43\uD835\uDC41). Observing the work of \uD835\uDD10 ∈ \uD835\uDD43 that calculates \uD835\uDD10  \uD835\uDC41 , it is possible to reject those \uD835\uDD10 for which:  The length of the work tape segment that \uD835\uDD10 makes use of indicates that \uD835\uDD10 ∉ \uD835\uDD42.\n At the processing of current question , the configuration of \uD835\uDD10 (i.e. the combination (state of \uD835\uDD10, position and content of the work tape)) was repeated, whence it follows that \uD835\uDD10 ∉ \uD835\uDD43\uD835\uDC41 .\nThus we can reject all TMs from \uD835\uDD43\\\uD835\uDD43\uD835\uDC41 and some TMs from \uD835\uDD43\uD835\uDC41\\\uD835\uDD42. Then it is possible to construct an enumerator ℛ, based on \uD835\uDC9C, on the definition of \uD835\uDD43, and on the described above rejection, such that \uD835\uDD42 ⊆ ℛ*\uD835\uDC41+ ⊆ \uD835\uDD43\uD835\uDC41 . Finally, it is possible to construct the following enumerator ℰ that enumerates generators:\nIf \uD835\uDC5B ≤ \uD835\uDC41, then\nℰ(\uD835\uDC5B),\uD835\uDC58- ≝ ℛ(\uD835\uDC5B) λ\uD835\uDC58 if \uD835\uDC58 ≤ \uD835\uDC41,\nλ if \uD835\uDC58 > \uD835\uDC41;\nand if \uD835\uDC5B > \uD835\uDC41, then ∀\uD835\uDC58∈ℕ(ℰ(\uD835\uDC5B),\uD835\uDC58- ≝ \uD835\uDF06).\nFor each ℭ ∈ \uD835\uDD42 there is an arbitrary TM in ℰ*\uD835\uDC41+ that is \uD835\uDC41-similar to ℭ , whereby the theorem statement follows from Item 2 of Lemma 3.1 9. □\n5. The strict Turing Test\n5.1. Definition of the strict Turing Test TM that is the subject of the test has some advantages: If this TM does not answer the test question simultaneously with SP, it passes the test (see Item 2.6.2). The choice of this condition is rather arbitrary and that allows us to consider the “strict” Turing test:\n TM fails the left (the right) strict test if either TM does not answer some test question (regardless whether SP has answered this question) or this test is finished with the correct result.\n TM fails the strict test if it fails both the left and the right strict test. We introduce for the strict tests notations \uD835\uDC47,\uD835\uDD10, \uD835\uDC59 , \uD835\uDC47,\uD835\uDD10,\uD835\uDCC7 , \uD835\uDC47,\uD835\uDD10,∗ , \uD835\uDC47,\uD835\uDD10 , \uD835\uDD10 ⊵ \uD835\uDC47,\nand \uD835\uDD10 ⋭T by analogy with the notations ,\uD835\uDC47,\uD835\uDD10, \uD835\uDC59-, ,\uD835\uDC47,\uD835\uDD10,\uD835\uDCC7-, ,\uD835\uDC47,\uD835\uDD10,∗-, ,\uD835\uDC47,\uD835\uDD10-, \uD835\uDD10 ⊳ \uD835\uDC47, and \uD835\uDD10 ⋫T for the ordinary tests. It is clear that if \uD835\uDD10 ⋫ \uD835\uDC47, then \uD835\uDD10 ⋭ \uD835\uDC47. Therefore, the statements of Lemma 3.1, Theorems 3.2, 4.2, 4.3, and Items 2 and 3 of Theorem 4.1 are extended to the case of the strict test. A different situation arises with the statement of Theorem 3.1 (and its corollary, Item 1 of Theorem 4.1): If SP of the tester \uD835\uDC47 reduces to TM \uD835\uDD14, then \uD835\uDD14 may fail the strict test \uD835\uDC47,\uD835\uDD14 (take for example TM \uD835\uDD14 that\n8 Note that Item 1 of Theorem 3.1 implies that SP of the described tester is not limited in time, and this\nis also clear from the principle of how this SP works. 9 Note that from Item 1 of Theorem 3.1 it follows that SP of the described tester does not belong to \uD835\uDD42, and this is also clear from the principle of how this SP works.\n7\ndoes not answer any question). However, the modified Theorem 3.1, given in following subsection, is valid for the strict test.\n5.2. Successfulness of the testers for the strict Turing test\nTHEOREM 5.1. 1. For each tester, which SP is reducible to TM, an arbitrary TM can pass the strict test\nwith this tester10.\n2.

For each tester T of the type (≻\uD835\uDD44, ≻\uD835\uDD44) some communicable TM ℭ can pass the strict\ntest \uD835\uDC47,ℭ 12. 4. For a given oracle \uD835\uDEF7 and for any TMs ℑ and \uD835\uDD14, the problem of constructing the TM \uD835\uDD10 that can pass the strict test ℑ\uD835\uDEF7 ,\uD835\uDD14 ,\uD835\uDD10 is algorithmically unsolvable13."

If \uD835\uDD14 answers all test questions, then the proof of Items 1 and 2 of the theorem coincides with the proof of Items 1 and 2 of Theorem 3.1.

By definition of interrogator ℑ\uD835\uDD14 \uD835\uDEF7 , it treats the answers of the subjects of the test\nsymmetrically, and that proves Item 1 of the lemma. Items 2 and 3 of the lemma follow from Item 1 of this lemma and from the dumbness of ℑ\uD835\uDD14 \uD835\uDEF7 . □\nTaking Lemma 5.1 into account for the strict tests with a tester that has a form of \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDD14 \uD835\uDEF7 , we\nshall discuss the number of the steps in the test and the answers of the subjects of the test without specifying the orientation of the test (the left one or the right one). To formulate and prove Lemmas 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, and 5.5 we need the following definitions and notations.\n Denote by  the number of words in the sequence  of words over \uD835\uDD38; we say that sequences of words  and  satisfy the relation ⥽ if any of the following cases holds:\n 0 =  < μ .  ∞ ≠  < μ and  is the beginning of .   = μ = ∞ and  = .\n10 An analogue of Item 1 of Theorem 3.1. 11 An analogue of Item 2 of Theorem 3.1. 12 An analogue of Item 1 of Theorem 4.1. 13 That accentuates the difference between the strict and the ordinary tests: See Item 1 of Theorem 3.1.\n8\n Fix some SP \uD835\uDD14 and put \uD835\uDD140 ≝ \uD835\uDD14, \uD835\uDD14\uD835\uDC5B+1 ≝ \uD835\uDD09 ℑ\uD835\uDD14\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDD14\uD835\uDC5B , \uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC5B ≝ ℑ\uD835\uDD14\uD835\uDC5B \uD835\uDEF7 , \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC5B ≝ \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDD14\uD835\uDC5B \uD835\uDEF7 , where \uD835\uDC5B ∈ ℕ0.\n For \uD835\uDC5B > 0 and the strict test \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC5B–1,\uD835\uDD14\uD835\uDC5B :\n Denote by (\uD835\uDC5B) the sequence of answers of SP \uD835\uDD14\uD835\uDC5B−1 in this test.

For \uD835\uDC5B > 0, \uD835\uDD14\uD835\uDC5B ⊵ \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC5B–1. Thus, owing to the specificity of how interrogator \uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC5B operates,\nonly the two following cases are possible: 1. The number of test steps is infinite, and moreover, (\uD835\uDC5B) = (\uD835\uDC5B). 2. SP \uD835\uDD14\uD835\uDC5B–1 has not answered to the \uD835\uDC57th (\uD835\uDC57 ≥ 1) test question that has been answered by\nTM \uD835\uDD14\uD835\uDC5B . Thus γ (\uD835\uDC5B) = (\uD835\uDC5B) + 1 and this implies that for \uD835\uDC57 = 1, the equation (\uD835\uDC5B) = 0 is satisfied, and for \uD835\uDC57 > 1, (\uD835\uDC5B) = γ1 (\uD835\uDC5B) , γ2 (\uD835\uDC5B) ,… , γ\uD835\uDC57−1 (\uD835\uDC5B) . □\nLEMMA 5.3. ∀\uD835\uDC5B∈ℕ  (\uD835\uDC5B) ⥽ (\uD835\uDC5B+1) .\nPROOF. Consider the tests \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC5B–1 ,\uD835\uDD14\uD835\uDC5B ,∗ and \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC5B ,\uD835\uDD14\uD835\uDC5B+1,∗ . The interrogators \uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC5B−1 and \uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC5B are\ndump, and \uD835\uDD14\uD835\uDC5B+1 ⊵ \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC5B . Thus  (\uD835\uDC5B) = (\uD835\uDC5B+1) or (\uD835\uDC5B) ⥽ (\uD835\uDC5B+1), due to the definition of \uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC5B . Then the proof follows from Lemma 5.2. □\nLEMMA 5.4. ∀\uD835\uDC5B∈ℕ( γ (\uD835\uDC5B) ≥ \uD835\uDC5B).\nPROOF. Lemma 5.2 implies that γ(1) > 0, and for \uD835\uDC5B > 1 the statement of the lemma follows\nfrom Lemma 5.3. □\nLEMMA 5.5. For each \uD835\uDC5B ∈ ℕ and for every \uD835\uDC58, where 0 < \uD835\uDC58 ≤ γ(\uD835\uDC5B) , the word γ\uD835\uDC58 (\uD835\uDC5B) is\ncalculated algorithmically.\nPROOF. Owing to definition of ℑ\uD835\uDD10, this TM can be algorithmically constructed from TM \uD835\uDD10. Then, due to definition of \uD835\uDD14\uD835\uDC5B , every ℑ\uD835\uDD14\uD835\uDC5B and thus every \uD835\uDD14\uD835\uDC5B can be algorithmically constructed from TM \uD835\uDD14. Finally, γ\uD835\uDC58 (\uD835\uDC5B) = \uD835\uDD14\uD835\uDC5B λ \uD835\uDC58 . □\n5.4. Proof of Item 4 of Theorem 5.1 To prove Item 4 of Theorem 5.1 assign to each \uD835\uDD14 ∈ \uD835\uDD44 the following generator ℌ\uD835\uDD14: ℌ\uD835\uDD14,\uD835\uDC5B- ≝ γ\uD835\uDC5B (\uD835\uDC5B) (ℌ\uD835\uDD14 is well defined due to Lemmas 5.4 and 5.5). Now, if  is the sequence of all answers of ℌ\uD835\uDD14, then according to Lemmas 5.3 and 5.4, (1) ⥽ , hence \uD835\uDD141 ⊵ \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDD14 \uD835\uDEF7 ⇒ ℌ\uD835\uDD14 ⊵ \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDD14 \uD835\uDEF7 ⇒ ℌ\uD835\uDD14 ⊳ \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDD14 \uD835\uDEF7 . Now construct the following enumerator ℰ that enumerates generators: ℰ(\uD835\uDC5B) ≝ ℌ\uD835\uDD04\uD835\uDC5B . We have ∀\uD835\uDC5B∈ℕ ℰ(\uD835\uDC5B) ⊳ \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDD04\uD835\uDC5B \uD835\uDEF7 and thus ∀\uD835\uDC47∈\uD835\uDD4B\uD835\uDEF7∃\uD835\uDC5B(ℰ(\uD835\uDC5B) ⊳ \uD835\uDC47).

    "abstractText" : "The Turing test was described by A. Turing in his paper [4] as follows: An interrogator questions both Turing machine and second participant of the test (a person), each of which tries to appear human. The interrogator does not know from whom exactly he receives answers and has the objective to tell the Turing machine from the person (for more details, see, for example, [3]). In this paper, we consider a formalization of the Turing test and obtain the following results (Figure 1.1):",
