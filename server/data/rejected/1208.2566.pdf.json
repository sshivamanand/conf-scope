      "text" : "Bylander 1994 made an extensive analysis of the computational complexity of propositional STRIPS under various restrictions, like limiting the number of preconditions or effects. Bäckström and Nebel 1995 made a similar analysis of planning with multi-valued state variables in the SAS+ formalism, investigating the complexity of all combinations of the P, U, B and S restrictions introduced by Bäckström and Klein 1991. These were among the first attempts to understand why and when planning is hard or easy and have had heavy influence on recent research in planning, of which we list a few representative examples. Giménez and Jonsson 2008, Chen and Giménez 2010 as well as Katz and Domshlak 2008 have studied the complexity of planning for various restrictions on the causal graph, the latter also considering combinations with restrictions P and U. Katz and Domshlak further pointed out a particularly important usage of such results, saying:\nComputational tractability can be an invaluable tool even for dealing with problems that fall outside all the known tractable fragments of planning. For instance, tractable fragments of planning provide the foundations for most (if not all) rigorous heuristic estimates employed in planning as heuristic search.\nTwo examples of slightly different ways to do this are the following. Helmert 2004 used a planning algorithm for a simpler restricted problem to compute heuristic values for subproblems and then combine these values. Similarly, the popular h+ heuristic Hoffmann (2005) exploits Bylander’s results that planning is simpler with only positive preconditions and uses this as a relaxation for computing a heuristic value. As a complement to such analyses of restricted planning lanugages, Helmert 2006 studied the complexity and inherent restrictions in a number of application problems.\nWe revisit these early classifications of STRIPS and of SAS+, but using parameterized complexity analysis rather than standard complexity analysis. Parameterized complexity analysis was invented to enable a more finegrained analysis than standard complexity analysis allows, by treating a parameter as independent of the instance rather than being a part of it. Somewhat simplified, the idea is as follows. Consider some problem and let\nn denote the instance size. We usually consider a problem as tractable if it can be solved by some algorithm in O(nc) time, that is, in polynomial time. For many problems, like the NP-hard problems, we do not know of any significantly faster way to solve them than doing brute-force search, which typically requires requires exponential, or at least super-polynomial, time in n. In practice the search is often not exponential in the size of the whole instance, but rather in some smaller hard part of it. In these cases the complexity may rather be something like O(2knc) where k is a parameter that is typically independent of the instance size n. Thus, the combinatorial explosion is confined to the parameter k. We say that a problem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) if it can be solved in this way. This is the essence of parameterized complexity theory and provides a tractability concept which is more relaxed than the usual one, while correlating better with tractability in practice for realworld problems. The theory also offers various classes for problems that are not FPT, for example W[1] and W[2]. Parameterized complexity analysis has contributed fundamental new insights into complexity theory Downey and Fellows (1999). It is nowadays a very common technique in many areas of computer science, including many subareas of AI, like non-monotonic reasoning Gottlob, Pichler, and Wei (2006), constraints Gaspers and Szeider (2011), social choice Brandt, Brill, and Seedig (2011) and argumentation Ordyniak and Szeider (2011). The examples in planning are rare, however. Downey, Fellows and Stege 1999 proved that STRIPS planning is W[1]hard and conjectured that it is also complete for W[1]. We disprove this conjecture and show that STRIPS planning is actually W[2]-complete. There is also a result by Bäckström and Jonsson 2011 that STRIPS planning is FPT under a certain restriction that deliberately lower-bounds the plan length, thus not contradicting our results. This restriction was motivated by a different agenda, studying the expressive power of planning languages in general rather than subclasses of a particular language.\nThe parameterized analyses of planning that we provide in this paper does not replace the earlier results or make them obsolete. Since the parameterized complexity classes and the standard ones are not comparable, our results must be viewed as supplementary, providing further information. If we consider the previous classifications together with our parameterized classification we get a more detailed and informative picture of planning complexity than by considering either of them alone. This sheds new light on the discrepancy between theoretical and practical results regarding the difficulty of planning. For instance, while Bäckström and Nebel proved that restriction U (actions can change only one variable) does not make planning easier under standard analysis, we show that it is actually easier from a parameterized point of view. This is interesting since restriction U has been considered acceptable in some practical applications of planning, for instance on-board planning in spacecrafts Williams and Nayak (1997); Brafman and Domshlak (2003). Furthermore, Bäckström and Nebel showed that planning is NP-hard under restriction P (there are never two actions that set the same variable value) but did not provide any better upper bound than in the unrestricted case. We show that planning is actually FPT under this restriction. We also show that a standard partial-order planning algorithm McAllester and Rosenblitt (1991) can exploit this fact with a minor modification that could be implemented as a heuristic. This suggests that many successful applications of planning might be cases where the problem is “almost tractable” and the algorithm used happens to implicitly exploit this. This is in line with the claim by Downey et. al. 2008 that in many cases existing algorithms with heuristics turn out to already be FPT algorithms.\nThe rest of the paper is laid out as follows. Section 2 defines some concepts of parameterized complexity theory and Section 3 defines the SAS+ and STRIPS languages. The hardness results are collected in Section 4 and the membership results in Section 5, including the result on using an existing planning algorithm. Section 6 summarizes the results of the paper and discusses some observations and consequences. The paper ends with a discussion in Section 7."

      "text" : "We define the basic notions of Parameterized Complexity and refer to other sources Downey and Fellows (1999); Flum and Grohe (2006) for an in-depth treatment. A parameterized problem is a set of pairs 〈I, k〉, the instances, where I is the main part and k the parameter. The parameter is usually a non-negative integer. A parameterized problem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) if there exists an algorithm that solves any instance 〈I, k〉 of size n in time f(k)nc where f is an arbitrary computable function and c is a constant independent of both n and k. FPT is the class of all fixed-parameter tractable decision problems.\nParameterized complexity offers a completeness theory, similar to the theory of NP-completeness, that al-\nlows the accumulation of strong theoretical evidence that some parameterized problems are not fixed-parameter tractable. This theory is based on a hierarchy of complexity classes\nFPT ⊆ W[1] ⊆ W[2] ⊆ W[3] ⊆ · · ·\nwhere all inclusions are believed to be strict. Each class W[i] contains all parameterized decision problems that can be reduced to a certain canonical parameterized problem (known as WEIGHTED i-NORMALIZED SATISFIABILITY) under parameterized reductions. A parameterized problem L reduces to a parameterized problem L′ if there is a mapping R from instances of L to instances of L′ such that\n1. 〈I, k〉 is a YES-instance of L if and only if 〈I′, k′〉 = R(I, k) is a YES-instance of L′,\n2. there is a computable function g such that k′ ≤ g(k), and\n3. there is a computable function f and a constant c such that R can be computed in time O(f(k) · nc), where n denotes the size of 〈I, k〉.\nNot much is known about the relationship between the parameterized complexity classes and the standard ones, except that P ⊆ FPT."

Each action a ∈ A has a precondition pre(a) ∈ (D+)n and an effect eff(a) ∈ (D+)n.

      "text" : "In this section we prove the two main hardness results of this paper. For the first proof we need the following W[2]-complete problem (Downey and Fellows, 1999, p. 464).\nHITTING SET Instance: A finite set S, a collection C of subsets of S and an integer k ≤ |C|. Parameter: The integer k. Question: Is there a hitting set H ⊆ S such that |H | ≤ k and H ∩ c 6= ∅ for every c ∈ C?\nTheorem 1. {B,S}-BOUNDED SAS+ PLANNING is W[2]-hard, even when the actions have no preconditions.\nProof. By parameterized reduction from HITTING SET. Let I = 〈S,C, k〉 be an instance of this problem. We construct an instance I′ = 〈P, k′〉, where P = 〈V,D,A, I,G〉, of the {B,S}-BOUNDED SAS+ PLANNING problem such that I has a hitting set of size at most k if and only if there is a plan of length at most k′ = k for I′ as follows. Let V = { vc | c ∈ C } and let A = {ae | e ∈ S} where eff(ae)[vc] = 1 if e ∈ c and eff(ae)[vc] = u otherwise. We set I = 〈0, . . . , 0〉 and G = 〈1, . . . , 1〉. Clearly, P satisfies restrictions B and S, and the actions have no preconditions. It is now routine to show that P has a plan of length at most k′ if and only if I has a hitting set of size k.\nWe continue with the second result. The following problem is W[1]-complete Pietrzak (2003).\nPARTITIONED CLIQUE Instance: A k-partite graph G = 〈V,E〉 with partition V1, . . . , Vk such that |Vi| = |Vj | = n for all i, where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ k. Parameter: The integer k. Question: Are there nodes v1, . . . , vk such that vi ∈ Vi for all i, where 1 ≤ i ≤ k and, {vi, vj} ∈ E for all i, where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ k? (The graph {{v1, . . . , vk}, {{vi, vj} | 1 ≤ i < j ≤ k}} is a k-clique of G.)\nTheorem 2. {U,B, S}-BOUNDED SAS+ PLANNING is W[1]-hard, even for instances where every action has at most one precondition and one postcondition.\nProof. By parameterized reduction from PARTITIONED CLIQUE. Let G = 〈V,E〉 be a k-partite graph where V is partitioned into V1, . . . , Vk. Let k2 = ( k 2 )\nand k′ = 7k2 + k. We define Ji = { j | 1 ≤ j ≤ k and j 6= i } for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k.\nFor the {U,B, S}-BOUNDED SAS+ PLANNING instance P we introduce four kinds of variables: 1) For every e ∈ E we introduce an edge variable x(e). 2) For every 1 ≤ i ≤ k and v ∈ Vi we introduce k − 1 vertex variables x(v, j) where j ∈ Ji. 3) For every 1 ≤ i ≤ k and every j ∈ Ji we introduce a checking variable x(i, j). 4) For every v ∈ V , we introduce a clean-up variable x(v).\nWe also introduce five kinds of actions: 1) For every e ∈ E we introduce an action ae such that eff(ae)[x(e)] = 1. 2) For every e = {vi, vj} ∈ E where vi ∈ Vi and vj ∈ Vj , we introduce two actions aei and a e j such that pre(aei )[x(e)] = 1, eff(a e i )[x(vi, j)] = 1, pre(a e j)[x(e)] = 1 and eff(a e j)[x(vj , i)] = 1.\n3) For every v ∈ Vi and j ∈ Ji, we introduce an action avj such that pre(a v j )[x(v, j)] = 1 and eff(a v j )[x(i, j)] =\n1. 4) For every v ∈ V , we introduce an action av such that eff(av)[x(v)] = 1. 5) For every v ∈ Vi, for some 1 ≤ i ≤ k, and j ∈ Ji, we introduce an action ajv such that pre(a j v)[x(v)] = 1 and eff(ajv)[x(v, j)] = 0. Let A1, . . . , A5 be sets of actions corresponding to these five groups, and let A = A1 ∪ . . . ∪ A5 be the set of all actions. Let I = 〈0, . . . , 0〉 and define G such that all checking variables x(i, j) are 1, all vertex variables x(v, j) are 0 and the rest are u.\nWe now need to prove that G has a k-clique if and only if there is a plan for P of length at most k′. We sketch the leftward direction; the opposite is similar. Assume G has a k-clique K = 〈VK , EK〉 where VK = {v1, . . . , vk} with vi ∈ Vi for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k. For all 1 ≤ i < j ≤ k, we apply the actions a{vi,vj} ∈ A1 and a {vi,vj} i , a {vi,vj} j ∈ A2. This gives 3k2 actions. Then for each checking variable x(i, j), for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k and j ∈ Ji, we apply a vi j ∈ A3. This gives 2k2 actions. Now we have all checking variables set to the required value 1, but the vertex variables x(vi, j), for 1 ≤ i ≤ k and j ∈ Ji, still bear the value 1 which will have to be set back to 0 in the goal state. So we need some actions to “clean up” the values of these vertex variables. First we set up a cleaner for each vertex vi by applying avi ∈ A4. This gives k actions. Then we use a j vi\n∈ A5 for all j ∈ Ji to set the vertex variables x(vi, j) to 0. This requires 2k2 actions. We observe that all the checking variables are now set to 1, and all vertex variables are set to 0. The goal state is therefore reached from the initial state by the execution of exactly k′ = k + 7k2 actions, as required."

BOUNDED SAS+ PLANNING is in W[2].\nProof. By parameterized reduction to the W[2]-complete problem Σ2,2-FO MODEL CHECKING. Let I = 〈P, k〉 (where P = 〈V,D,A, I,G〉) be an instance of BOUNDED SAS+ PLANNING. We construct an instance I′ = 〈A(P), ϕ〉 of Σ2,2-FO MODEL CHECKING such that I has a solution if and only if I′ has a solution and the size of the formula ϕ is bounded by some function that only depends on k. Assume without loss of generality that A contains a dummy action â with no preconditions and no effects. To define ϕ we first need the following definitions.\nWe define a formula value(〈a1, . . . , ai〉, v, x) such that value(〈〉, v, x) = Init(v, x) and value(〈a1, . . . , ai〉, v, x) = (value(〈a1, . . . , ai−1〉, v, x)∧¬Eff(ai, v))∨Effv(ai, v, x) for every 0 ≤ i ≤ k, which holds if applying a1, . . . , ai in state I results in a state s such that s[v] = x.\nWe also define a formula check-pre(〈a1, . . . , ai〉, v, x) = Prev(ai, v, x) → value(〈a1, . . . , ai−1〉, v, x) for all 1 ≤ i ≤ k, that is, ∀v∀x.Var(v) ∧ Dom(x) ∧ check-pre(〈a1, . . . , ai〉, v, x) holds if all preconditions of action ai are satisfied after actions a1, . . . , ai−1 have been executed in state I . We similarly define a formula check-pre-all(〈a1, . . . , ak〉, v, x) = ∧k\ni=1 check-pre(〈a1, . . . , ai〉, v, x) that “checks” the preconditions of all actions in a sequence.\nFinally, define check-goal(〈a1, . . . , ak〉, v, x) = Goalv(v, x) → value(〈a1, . . . , ak〉, v, x). The formula ∀v∀x.Var(v) ∧ Dom(x) ∧ check-goal(〈a1, . . . , ak〉, v, x) holds if the goal state is reached after the execution of the sequence a1, . . . , ak in the state I .\nWe can now define the formula ϕ itself as:\nϕ = ∃a1 . . . ∃ak∀v∀x .\n( ∧k\ni=1 Act(ai)) ∧ (Var(v) ∧ Dom(x) →\ncheck-pre-all(〈a1, . . . , ak〉, v, x) ∧ check-goal(〈a1, . . . , ak〉, v, x)).\nEvidently ϕ ∈ Σ2,2, the length of ϕ is bounded by some function that only depends on k and A(P) |= ϕ if and only if P has a plan of length at most k. The dummy action guarantees that there is a plan exactly of length k if there is a shorter plan.\nThe proof of the next theorem resembles the previous proof but the details are a bit involved. Thus, we only provide a high-level description of it.\nTheorem 4. {U}-BOUNDED SAS+ PLANNING is in W[1].\nProof sketch: In order to show W[1]-membership of {U}-BOUNDED SAS+ PLANNING we will reduce this problem to Σ1-FO MODEL CHECKING and the basic idea is fairly close to the proof of Theorem 3. However, we cannot directly express withinΣ1 that all the preconditions of an action are satisfied, as this would require a further universal quantification and thus move the formula to Σ2,u. Hence, we avoid the universal quantification with a trick: we observe that the preconditions only need to be checked with respect to at most k “important” variables, that is, the variables in which the preconditions of an action differ from the initial state. If the precondition differs in more than k variables from the initial state, then it cannot be used in any plan of length k. It is now possible to guess the important variables with existential quantifiers.\nIt remains to check that all the significant variables are among these guessed variables. We do this without universal quantification by adding dummy elements d1, . . . , dk and a relation Diff-act to the relational structure A(P). The relation associates with each action exactly k different elements. These elements consist of all the important variables of the action, say the number of these variables is k′, plus k−k′ dummy elements. Hence, by guessing these k elements and eliminating the dummy elements, the formula knows all the significant variables of the action and can check the preconditions without a universal quantification."

      "heading" : "5.2 Partial-order Planning",
      "text" : "To prove that {P}-BOUNDED SAS+ PLANNING is in FPT we use a slight modification of the well-known planning algorithm by McAllester and Rosenblitt 1991, which we refer to as MAR. It appears in Figure 1, combining the original and the modified versions into one. The only modification is the value of L′, which could easily be\nimplemented as a heuristic for the original algorithm. The algorithm is generalized to SAS+ rather than propositional STRIPS, which is straightforward and appears in the literature Bäckström (1994). We only explain the algorithm and our notation, referring the reader to the original paper for details.\nThe algorithm works on a partially ordered set of action occurences, each occurence being a unique copy of an action. For each precondition pre(oc)[v] 6= u of an occurence oc, the algorithm uses a causal link op v=x −→ oc to explicitly keep track of which other occurence op with eff(op)[v] = x guarantees this precondition. An occurence ot is a threat to op v=x −→ oc if eff(ot)[v] 6= u and op 6= ot 6= oc. A plan structure for a planning instance P = 〈V,D,A, I,G〉 is a tuple Θ = 〈O,P,L〉 where O is a finite set of action occurences over A, P is a binary relation over O and L is a set of causal links. We write o ≺ o′ for 〈o, o′〉 ∈ P. Furthermore, O always contains the two special elements oI , oG, where eff(oI) = I , pre(oG) = G and oI ≺ oG ∈ P. An open goal in Θ is a tuple 〈o, v, x〉 such that o ∈ O, pre(o)[v] = x 6= u and there is no o′ ∈ O such that o′ v=x −→ o ∈ L.\nWe say Θ is complete if both the following conditions hold: 1) For all oc ∈ O and all v ∈ V such that pre(oc)[v] = x 6= u, there is a causal link op v=x −→ oc ∈ L. 2) For every op v=x −→ oc ∈ L and every threat ot ∈ O to op v=x −→ oc, either ot ≺ op ∈ P or oc ≺ ot ∈ P. McAllester and Rosenblitt proved that if starting with Θ = 〈{oI , oG}, {oI ≺ oG},∅〉 then the algorithm fails if there is no plan and otherwise returns a plan structure 〈O,P,L〉 such that any topological sorting of O− {oI , oG} consistent with P is a plan.\nThat the modified variant of MAR is correct for SAS+-P instances is based on the following observation about the original variant applied to such instances. Consider three occurences o1, o2, o3 such that o1 has preconditions v = x and w = y which are both effects of o2. If v = x is also an effect of o3, then also w = y must be an effect of o3 due to restriction P. However, the algorithm must link both conditions from the same occurence, either o2 or o3, since it would otherwise add both o2 ≺ o3 and o3 ≺ o2, causing it to fail. The set of possible outcomes for the two variants are thus identical, but the modified variant is an FPT algorithm.\nTheorem 5. {P}-BOUNDED SAS+ PLANNING is in FPT.\nProof. Consider the modified version of MAR. All nodes in the search tree run in polynomial time in the instance size. The search tree contains two types of nodes: leafs that terminate in either line 2 or 3 and nodes that make a nondeterministic choice either in line 5 or in line 7 and then make a recursive call. The latter nodes correspond to branching points in the search tree, and we analyse their contribution to the search-tree size separately.\nEach time line 5 is visited, it adds a new element to P, which thus grows monotonically along every branch in the search tree. We can thus visit line 5 at most (k + 2)2 times along any branch since |P| ≤ (k + 2)2. There are two choices in line 5 so it contributes at most a factor 2(k+2) 2\nto the size of the search tree. Also O grows monotonically along every branch and |O| ≤ k+ 2. At any visit to lines 6–10 there are thus at most k+1 occurences with open goals and at most k+1 different occurences to link these goals to. That is, the preconditions of each occurence are partitioned into at most k + 1 parts, each part having all its elements linked at once in line 9. Lines 6–10 can thus be visited at most (k + 1)2 times along any branch in the search tree. Since there are at most k + 1 existing occurences to link to and at most one action to instantiate as a new occurence, the branching factor is k+2. The contribution of this to the size of the search tree is thus at most a factor (k+2)(k+1) 2\n. Hence, the total search-tree size is at most 2 · 2(k+2) 2 (k + 2)(k+1) 2\nwhere the factor 2 accounts for the leaves. This does not depend on the instance size and each node is polynomial-time in the instance size so the modified MAR algorithm is an FPT algorithm."

The W[2]-completeness results follow from Theorems 1 and 3, the W[1]-completeness results follow from Theorems 2 and 4, and the FPT results follow from Theorem 5.\nBylander 1994 studied the complexity of STRIPS under varying numbers of preconditions and effects, which is natural to view as a relaxation of restriction U in SAS+. Table 1 shows such results (for arbitrary domain sizes ≥ 2) under both parameterized and standard analysis. The parameterized results are derived as follows. For actions with an arbitrary number of effects, the results follow from Theorems 1 and 3. For actions with at most one effect, we have two cases: With no preconditions the problem is trivially in P. Otherwise, the results follow from Theorems 2 and 4.\nWe are left with the case when the number of effects is bounded by some constant me > 1. Bäckström 1992, proof of Theorem 6.7 presented a polynomial time reduction of this class of SAS+ instances to the class of instances with one effect.

For the final case (mp = 0), we have no corresponding parameterized hardness result.\nAll non-parameterized hardness results in Table 1 follow directly from Bylander’s 1994, Fig. 1 and 2 complexity results for STRIPS. Note that we use results both for bounded and unbounded plan existence, which is justified since the unbounded case is (trivially) polynomial-time reducible to the bounded case. The membership results for PSPACE are immediate since BOUNDED SAS+ PLANNING is in PSPACE. The membership results for NP (when mp = 0) follow from Bylander’s 1994 Theorem 3.9, which says that every solvable STRIPS instance with mp = 0 has a plan of length ≤ m where m is the number of actions. It is easy to verify that the same bound holds for SAS+ instances.\nSince W[1] and W[2] are not directly comparable to the standard complexity classes we get interesting separations from combining the two methods. For instance, we can single out restriction U as making planning easier than in the general case, which is not possible with standard analysis. Since restrictions B and S remain as hard as the general case even under parameterized analysis, this shows that U is a more interesting and important restriction than the other two. Even more interesting is that planning is in FPT under restriction P, making it easier than the combination restriction US, while it seems to be rather the other way around for standard analysis where restriction P is only known to be hard for NP. In general, we see that there are still a number of open problems of this type in both Figure 2 and Table 1 for the standard analysis, while there is only one single open problem for the parameterized analysis: hardness for the case where mp = 0 and me is fixed."

      "heading" : "7 Discussion",
      "text" : "This work opens up several new research directions. We briefly discuss some of them below. Although a modification was needed to make MAR an FPT algorithm for restriction P, no modification is necessary if also the number of preconditions of each action is bounded by a constant c. Then we can even relax P, such that for some constant d there can be at most d actions with the same effect. The proof is similar to the one for Theorem 5, using that the total number of causal links is bounded by c(k+1) and the branching factor in line 7 is k + 1 + d. This is an important observation since many application and example problems in planning satisfy these constraints, for instance, many variants of the LOGISTICS domain used in the international planning competitions. Since planners like NONLIN and SNLP are practical variants of MAR, this may help to explain the gap between empirical and theoretical results for many applications.\nThe use of parameterized analysis in planning is by no means restricted to using plan length as parameter. We did so only to get results that are as comparable as possible with the previous results. For instance, Downey et. al. 1999 show that STRIPS planning can be recast as the SIGNED DIGRAPH PEBBLING problem which is modelled as a special type of graph. They analyse the parameterized complexity of this problem considering also the treewidth of the graph as a parameter. As another example, Chen and Giménez 2010 show that planning is in P if the size of the connected components in the causal graph is bounded by a constant, and otherwise unlikely to be in P. It seems natural to study this also from a parameterized point of view, using the component size as the parameter. It should also be noted that the parameter need not be a single value; it can itself be a combination of two or more other parameters.\nThere are close ties between model checking and planning and this connection deserves further study. For instance, model-checking traces can be viewed as plans and vice versa Edelkamp, Leue, and Visser (2007), and methods and results have been transferred between the two areas in both directions Edelkamp (2003); Wehrle and Helmert (2009); Edelkamp, Kellershoff, and Sulewski (2010). Our reductions from planning to model-checking suggest that the problems are related also on a more fundamental level than just straightforward syntactical translations."

    "abstractText" : "The early classifications of the computational complexity of planning under various restrictions in STRIPS (Bylander) and SAS (Bäckström and Nebel) have influenced following research in planning in many ways. We go back and reanalyse their subclasses, but this time using the more modern tool of parameterized complexity analysis. This provides new results that together with the old results give a more detailed picture of the complexity landscape. We demonstrate separation results not possible with standard complexity theory, which contributes to explaining why certain cases of planning have seemed simpler in practice than theory has predicted. In particular, we show that certain restrictions of practical interest are tractable in the parameterized sense of the term, and that a simple heuristic is sufficient to make a well-known partial-order planner exploit this fact.",
