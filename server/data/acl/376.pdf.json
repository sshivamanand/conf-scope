      "text" : "Information and communication technologies have provided tools and methods to make the production of information more democratic. As a result, a vast amount of content is available, which arguably creates more noise than knowledge at the end of the day. Without hierarchical organization and contextualization, users may lack perspective to understand and assimilate the multiplicity of events that they come accross every day, and to link them to related events in the past.\nIn this context, we need tools for extracting, aggregating and visualizing knowledge in order to facilitate information analysis and access a variety of points of view. In this article, we take the example of the geopolitical alliances and their evolution; we extract relations from the texts and aggregate them in order to turn a set of very focused pieces of information into a broader knowledge and a bigger picture of a given situation.\nThe main contributions of this paper are:\n• Relation extraction: we present an eventbased, recursive neural network approach for identifying alliance and opposition relations between countries, at sentence level, in English. We show that adapting the models\nto the eventive nature of extracted relations helps existing recursive neural models. We use a precision-oriented cost function for a better later aggregation.\n• Relation aggregation: we aggregate the sentence-level relations in a multi-document environment, in order to obtain a picture of the geopolitical situation and evolution on a specific subject defined by a user query (e.g., situation in Syria, nuclear proliferation, North Pole ownership). We cope with the inevitable amount of noise to produce reliable numerical data from texts."

For each day, POS and NEG relations are aggregated and a tendency of this day is obtained, as well as a trend over time. A graphical visualization of this trend is then proposed to the user.\nWe chose to use only titles because we can consider that a title describes only one event, and that this event can be time-stamped by the document creation time, which is not true in article content. However, this comes with a drawback : titles in English often follow some different syntactic rules than traditional sentences, as in examples 2 (coordination expressed with only a comma) and 5 (contracted reported speech).

All these elements were considered as entities potentially parts of an alliance/opposition relation.\nWe used a corpus of 3.3 millions of English news titles from about 20 different web news sites, between 2013 and early 2016 (3,000 documents/day in average). From this corpus, we randomly selected titles containing at least two entities. Each pair of entities is an instance of the classifier, which means that one sentence can lead to several instances. Furthermore, we added the heads of the nominal phrase containing these entities, as well as “person triggers” (man, minister, etc.) in order to refine the training. For example:\n(6) EU, U.N. condemn Ukraine rebels’ election plans. → NEG(EU, rebels), NEG(UN, rebels), POS(EU, Ukraine), POS(UN, Ukraine), POS(EU,UN)\nthe word rebels is added to EU, U.N. and Ukraine, leading to five possible pairs (entities\nfrom the same chunks are not considered).1 These extra entities are expected to help the model use all possible information.\nAmong all these automatically collected entities, we manually annotated 5172 pairs with polarities NEU (2837 instances), NEG (1473 instances) and POS (862 instances), coming from 2166 different titles (between 1 and 15 pairs in a title).

In a ShortestPath (SP) model, we use the same representation but we keep only nodes and branches that are part of the shortest dependency path (see Figure 2.c then 2.b, where the “oil deal” is pruned but “president” is added), as experimented by Xu et al. (2015) for LSTM networks.\nDependency tree recursive neural networks (Socher et al., 2014) generalizes to non-binary trees by considering as many composition matrices as necessary (until one matrix per dependency type). This will allow us to manipulate the tree as desired in our Event-Centered (EC) model described in the following section.\nAs we do not seek for general knowledge but for changing relationships, the entities themselves are replaced by generic *START* and *END* words, as well as proper nouns that are replaced by *PN*. This guarantees that the model will really learn the relational structure rather than the specific connection between two countries. This also gives us a way to represent the entities in the structure, without having to stick to the exact path between them (as in Socher et al. (2012)) or to add positional features (as in Zeng et al. (2014))."

      "heading" : "3.3 Event-Centered Modeling",
      "text" : "A known issue of recursive models is that their deep tree structure leads to a bias towards the topmost nodes (Kalchbrenner et al., 2014). We turn this problem into a desirable feature by pushing the main event governing the relation to the top of the structure.3 This section details this operation, illustrated by Figures 2.c, 2.d and 2.e.\nAt step ¬, dependencies from Stanford parser are renamed by the position of the dependent w.r.t the governor (LEFT is the dependent if before the governor in the sentence, RIGHT otherwise). Only the path between entities is kept. Then (step ), each branch node (agree, with and president) is extracted and converted into a leaf node, with an edge labeled MAIN going from this leaf node to the former position of the word. This label represents the fact that the word is the governor of its tree sibling in a dependency.\n3Therefore, we do not use any node weighting nor normalization by the number of words underneath them, unlike in previous work (Socher et al., 2011, 2014).\n4\n301\n302\n303\n304\n305\n306\n307\n308\n309\n310\n311\n312\n313\n314\n315\n316\n317\n318\n319\n320\n321\n322\n323\n324\n325\n326\n327\n328\n329\n330\n331\n332\n333\n334\n335\n336\n337\n338\n339\n340\n341\n342\n343\n344\n345\n346\n347\n348\n349\n350\n351\n352\n353\n354\n355\n356\n357\n358\n359\n360\n361\n362\n363\n364\n365\n366\n367\n368\n369\n370\n371\n372\n373\n374\n375\n376\n377\n378\n379\n380\n381\n382\n383\n384\n385\n386\n387\n388\n389\n390\n391\n392\n393\n394\n395\n396\n397\n398\n399\nWe obtain a structure that we call EventCentered (EC), that can be processed by a dependency tree recursive model. For example, in Figure 2.e, the root vector r is calculated as follows:\nr = f(WLEFT ·p1+WMAIN ·wagree+WRIGHT ·p2+b)\nThe top node of EC trees can have three children, all the others have only two. Only three matrices (WMAIN,WLEFT,WRIGHT) are created, keeping the number of parameters reasonable. Figure 3 illustrates two more examples of conversion.\nAs our relations are triggered by events, we expect at least one event word to be part of the dependency path between the two entities (we call an event word either a non-state verb or a noun tagged as act or event in WordNet (Miller, 1995)). It may not be the case, either because of a specific structure of the sentence or because of a parser error, mainly due to the speficities of titles or to traditional bad prepositional attachments. We now describe how we force the path to contain an event word.\nIf the dependency path from E1 to E2 does not contain any event word, we extend this path by collecting common ancestors until we meet one. For example, in the following sentence:\n(7) Japan and China agree to reduce tensions over Senkaku islands\nthe path is turned from Japan–conj–China to agree—Japan—China.4\nIf no event word is found, then the closest event word to E1 and E2 (or as a last resort, the root node) is attached to the entities. This is the case in\n(8) ISIS militants attack Syrian town near Turkey border\nwith the (erroneous) initial dependency graph\nwhere attack is not in the path, but is added because attack is an event word. The graph is then centered on this event so that we obtain a tree as described before:\nUsing positional relations instead of real dependency names allows to twist the graph as desired to save what can be saved from an erroneous graph.\n4Note that we used the uncollapsed version of Stanford dependency graphs in order to keep word vectors for prepositions. Not doing so decreases dramatically the results."

      "text" : "Our final application aggregates the sentencebased relations and uses a large corpus where the same relation on the same day will be expressed many times in different manners. This is why, faced with the traditional trade-off dilemma between precision and recall, we want to favor precision, for two reasons:\n• Aggregating results with poor precision tends to lead to wrong aggregated values.\n• The corpus redundancy will help to gather useful information even with a classifier with lower recall.\nWe then bias the classical cross-entropy error function by adding a penalty to false positives (i.e. POS or NEG erroneous predictions). For each relation r represented by the parameter vector θ, the error function is then\nE(r; θ) = −λFP\n( 3∑\nk=1\ntk log dk(r; θ)\n)\nwhere k represents each of the three classes POS, NEG and NEU, tk is the kth element of the multinomial target label distribution t for a relation, dk(r; θ) the 3-dimensional output of the softmax layer. Finally, λFP = 1 if the prediction is correct or false negative (NEU instead of POS or NEG) and λFP = α (with α > 1) if the prediction is a false positive, so that it is more costly. This can also be seen as an extra regularization parameter on the sum of all false positive predictions. In our experiments, we choose α such that it guarantees a precision higher than 80% on dev POS and NEG classes and maximizes the overall accuracy."

The problem here is that our classifier provides a relation between two countries independently of the others; it is therefore very unlikely that these values can be used as distance values in the whole graph (especially, triangle inequality will not be respected). For this reason, we use the Barnes-Hut force-directed layout algorithm (Barnes and Hut, 1986), where a value between two vertices is considered as a repulsive force. The algorithm tries to minimize the energy spent to keep the whole graph together, and then to adapt the distances between vertices so that the rendering on a 2D plan is possible.\nFor this algorithm, we need to transform our weights sw(d) into positive numbers (repulsive forces). We also need to damp the noise and the variations of the weights that are introduced by the volume of data. This problem is illustrated by Table 2, where three countries A1, A2 and A3 are allies against another one B on a given topic and a given time span. The weights sw(d) of the three relations between allies are positive but vary between 1 and 3.5. As a result, A1 is finally closer to B (difference of 2) than to A2 (difference of 2.5), which is not desirable.\nThis kind of effects can be corrected by a “Sshaped”, logistic function, that models a level of saturation after an approximately exponential growth (or, in our case, decrease):\nsw′(d) = 1− 1 1 + e−sw(d)\n(9)\nThis function levels off high weights (both negative and positive), increases differences between positive and negative values and thus helps reducing noise without having to discretize values arbitrarily. Resulting numbers are all positive, between 0 (strong alliance, attraction in the graph) and 1 (strong opposition, repulsion in the graph).\nFigure 5 shows an example of such graphs obtained by the force-directed algorithm, with the keyword syria.\n7\n601\n602\n603\n604\n605\n606\n607\n608\n609\n610\n611\n612\n613\n614\n615\n616\n617\n618\n619\n620\n621\n622\n623\n624\n625\n626\n627\n628\n629\n630\n631\n632\n633\n634\n635\n636\n637\n638\n639\n640\n641\n642\n643\n644\n645\n646\n647\n648\n649\n650\n651\n652\n653\n654\n655\n656\n657\n658\n659\n660\n661\n662\n663\n664\n665\n666\n667\n668\n669\n670\n671\n672\n673\n674\n675\n676\n677\n678\n679\n680\n681\n682\n683\n684\n685\n686\n687\n688\n689\n690\n691\n692\n693\n694\n695\n696\n697\n698\n699\nFigure 4: Example of plot produced by the system for bilateral relations between United States and Russia on the query “Syria”, on a daily scale.

      "text" : "Evaluating the relevance of trends suggested by a plot or a dynamic map is very subjective and would require a high level of expertise in each domain concerned by the tested queries. That is why we opted for a protocol that is at the same time more objective and easier to conduct:\n1. We chose 14 queries with the following information: names of two countries (or unions of countries) involved in the relation, and an optional keyword-based thematic restriction. We selected queries having potentially a high density of extracted relations (e.g. North Korea vs. South Korea, or Russia vs. United Nations on “Syria”), as well as sparser topics (China vs. Japan on maritime affairs).\n2. On the resulting plot, we selected up to 5 strong peaks — abs(sw(d)) > 1 — and 5 weak peaks — abs(sw(d)) ≤ 1. This led to a total of 97 relations to evaluate.\n3. For each of these peaks, we estimated whether the polarity of the peak was relevant or not, from a different news article collection. This is still a heavy task, which explains the low number of tested instances.\nThe accuracy of strong peaks is 0.93, making them highly reliable. Accuracy of weak peaks is 0.752."

The idea of automatically finding topically related material in streams of newswire data goes back to Topic Detection and Tracking evaluation campaigns (Allan, 2002). These campaigns and the follow-up research aim at developing algorithms for identifying and organizing events described in documents.\nOur work contributes to this global research effort and explores the quantitative aspects of knowledge that can be extracted from textual documents.

Different opinions must be aggregated, not only for getting more information, as in multidocument information extraction, but also for balancing positive and negative statements and conclude about the average opinion.\nFewer research works focused on extracting opinion relations between entities, including Gottipati et al. (2013); Yang and Cardie (2013); Johansson and Moschitti (2013), that can be related to our work.\nInternational Relations. TABARI (a.k.a. KEDS) is an open-source program extracting events concerning international relations from news texts (Schrodt and Yonamine, 2012). This rule-based system makes extensive use of handcrafted dictionaries and patterns. It has been widely used in the field of political science, for example for modeling dependencies in international relations networks (Hoff and Ward, 2004), as well as in the GDELT Project.6 Several versions have been proposed for studying different aspects of international relations (Levant, Turkey, Balkans, Political Instability Task Force, etc.) and a more general-purpose set of rules, CAMEO, has also been developed (Schrodt et al., 2008). We compare it to our approach, after a few necessary adaptations (Section 4.1). More recently, (Boschee et al., 2013) presented a proprietary system and compare to TABARI as well.\nWith very different approaches, O’Connor et al. (2013) describe an unsupervised model for extracting events between political actors, and Gerrish (2013) presents a time-series topic model of foreign affairs. Similar aspects with our work are the detection of conflicts, as well as the interest in the temporal evolution of these conflicts and a general approach for studying specific situations. However, the purpose and output (distributions of topical terms) are different.\nFinally, Chambers et al. (2015) describe an identification of political sentiment between nations at the citizen level, by using a large Twitter dataset. Their work is more directly related to traditional sentiment analysis and does not rely specifically on geopolitical events, even if the observed trends can follow these events.\n6http://gdeltproject.org\nNeural Networks for Relation Extraction. Several neural network models have been used for sentiment analysis and relation extraction. Examples are convolutional networks (Zeng et al., 2014; Nogueira dos Santos et al., 2015), recurrent networks such as LSTM (Xu et al., 2015) or recursive networks (Socher et al., 2011, 2012, 2013). Li et al. (2015) shows that using tree structures, as do recursive models, helps in tasks where longdistance relations are involved, such as semantic relation extraction. The results described in this paper confirm this conclusion.\nOur precision-oriented approach relies on linguistic variation and redundancy in a large amount of documents to ensure a good coverage (Yates, 2007). It is related to some works in web questionanswering (Dumais et al., 2002; M.Banko et al., 2002; Magnini et al., 2002), temporal information aggregation (Kessler et al., 2012) or opinion mining (Turney, 2002; Hu and Liu, 2004)."

      "text" : "The advances in information extraction techniques and the increase of computing power make possible quite deep analysis of very large collections of texts. In this paper, we propose to take advantage of this progress to aggregate a large volume of extracted relations and to turn this knowledge into numerical data. We also propose a tool identifying the evolution of alliance and opposition relations between countries, on a specific subject.\nMost information conveyed every day remains textual and unstructured. With such applications, a wide new range of knowledge can become available, in many different fields, which would bring high added value to the final users, in terms of aggregation, contextualization and hierarchical organization of information. We see our international relations example as a use case study of this effort.\nWe now intend to focus on reducing the necessary amount of supervision by using distant supervision, so that different subjects could be treated with less effort. Also, such study on country relationships should be multilingual in order to consider the cultural dimension as well.\nThis article is accompanied with supplementary material: the annotated corpus, the FT, SP and EC versions of all relations (JSON format), the script converting text into each of these versions, and the source for our recursive models.\n9\n801\n802\n803\n804\n805\n806\n807\n808\n809\n810\n811\n812\n813\n814\n815\n816\n817\n818\n819\n820\n821\n822\n823\n824\n825\n826\n827\n828\n829\n830\n831\n832\n833\n834\n835\n836\n837\n838\n839\n840\n841\n842\n843\n844\n845\n846\n847\n848\n849\n850\n851\n852\n853\n854\n855\n856\n857\n858\n859\n860\n861\n862\n863\n864\n865\n866\n867\n868\n869\n870\n871\n872\n873\n874\n875\n876\n877\n878\n879\n880\n881\n882\n883\n884\n885\n886\n887\n888\n889\n890\n891\n892\n893\n894\n895\n896\n897\n898\n899"
