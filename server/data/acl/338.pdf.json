      "text" : "With the rapid growth of products reviews at the web, it has become common for people to read reviews before making purchase decision. The reviews usually contain abundant consumers’ personal experiences. It has led to a significant influence on financial gains and fame for businesses. Existing studies have shown that an extra halfstar rating on Yelp causes restaurants to sell out 19% points more frequently (Anderson and Magruder, 2012), and a one-star increase in Yelp rating leads to a 5-9 % increase in revenue (Luca, 2011). This, unfortunately, gives strong incentives for imposters (called spammers) to game the system. They post fake reviews or opinions (called review spam) to promote or to discredit some targeted products and services. The news from BBC has shown that around 25% of Yelp reviews could be fake.1 Therefore, it is urgent to detect review s-\n1http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-24299742\npam, to ensure that the online review continues to be trusted.\nJindal and Liu (2008) make the first step to detect review spam. Most efforts are devoted to explore effective linguistic and behavioral features by subsequent work to distinguish such spam from the real reviews. However, to notice such patterns or form behavioral features, developers should take long time to observe the data, because the features are based on statistics. For instance, the feature activity window proposed by Mukherjee et al. (2013c) is to measure the activity freshness of reviewers. It usually takes several months to count the difference of timestamps between the last and first reviews for reviewers. When the features show themselves finally, some major damages might have already been done. Thus, it is important to design algorithms that can detect review spam as soon as possible, ideally, right after they are posted by the new reviewers. It is a coldstart problem which is the focus of this paper.\nIn this paper, we assume that we must identify fake reviews immediately when a new reviewer posts just one review. Unfortunately, it is very difficult because the available information for detecting fake reviews is very poor. Traditional behavioral features based on the statistics can only work well on users’ abundant behaviors. The more behavioral information obtained, the more effective the traditional behavioral features are (see experiments in Section 3 ). In the scenario of cold-start, a new reviewer only has a behavior: post a review. As a result, we can not get effective behavioral features from the data. Although, the linguistic features of reviews do not need to take much time to form, Mukherjee et al. (2013c) have proved that the linguistic features are not effective enough in detecting real-life fake reviews from the commercial websites, where we also obtain the same observation (the details are shown in Section 3).\n2\n101\n102\n103\n104\n105\n106\n107\n108\n109\n110\n111\n112\n113\n114\n115\n116\n117\n118\n119\n120\n121\n122\n123\n124\n125\n126\n127\n128\n129\n130\n131\n132\n133\n134\n135\n136\n137\n138\n139\n140\n141\n142\n143\n144\n145\n146\n147\n148\n149\n156\n157\n158\n159\n160\n161\n162\n163\n164\n165\n166\n167\n168\n169\n170\n171\n172\n173\n174\n175\n176\n177\n178\n179\n180\n181\n182\n183\n184\n185\n186\n187\n188\n189\n190\n191\n192\n193\n194\n195\n196\n197\n198\n199\nTherefore, the main difficulty of the cold-start spam problem is that there is no sufficient behaviors of the new reviewers for constructing effective behavioral features. Nevertheless, there are ample textual and behavioral information contained in the abundant reviews posted by the existing reviewers (Figure 1). We could employ behavioral information of existing similar reviewers to a new reviewer to approximate his behavioral features. We argue that a reviewer’s individual characteristics such as background information, motivation and interactive behavior style have a great influence on a reviewer’s textual and behavioral information. So the textual information and the behavioral information of a reviewer are correlated with each other (similar argument in Li et al. (2016)). For example, the students of college are likely to choose the youth hostel during summer vacation, and tend to comment the room price in their reviews. But the financial analysts on business trip may tend to choose the business hotel, the environment and service are what they care about in their reviews.\nTo augment the behavioral information of the new reviewers in the cold-start problem, we first try to find the textual information which is similar with that of the new reviewer, from the existing reviews. There are several ways to model the textual information of the review spam, such as Unigram (Mukherjee et al., 2013c), POS (Ott et al., 2011) and LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) (Newman et al., 2003). We employ the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to model the review text, which has been proved that it can capture complex global semantic information that is difficult to express using traditional discrete manual features (Ren and Zhang, 2016). Then we employ the behavioral information which is correlated with the found textual information to approximate the behavioral information of the new reviewer. An intuitive approach is to search the most similar existing review for the new review, then take the found reviewer’s behavioral features as the new reviewers’ features (detailed in Section 5.3). However, there are abundant behavioral information in the review graph (Figure 1), it is difficult for the traditional discrete manual behavioral features to record the global behavioral information (Wang et al., 2016). Moreover, the traditional features can not capture the reviewer’s individual characteristics, because there is no explicit characteristic tag available in the review system (experi-\nments in Section 5.3). So, we propose a neural network model to jointly encode the textual and behavioral information into the review embeddings for detecting the review spam in cold-start problem. By encoding the review graph structure (Figure 1), the proposed model can record the global footprints of the existing reviewers in an unsupervised way, and further record the reviewers’ latent characteristic information in the footprints. The jointly learnt review embeddings can model the correlation of the reviewers’ textual and behavioral information. When a new reviewer posts a review, the proposed model can represent the review with the similar textual information and the correlated behavioral information encoded in the word embeddings. Finally, the embeddings of the new review are fed into a classifier to identify whether it is spam or not.\nIn summary, our major contributions include: • To our best knowledge, this is the first work\nthat explores the cold-start problem in review spam detection. We qualitatively and quantitatively prove that the traditional linguistic and behavioral features are not effective enough in detecting review spam for the coldstart task. • We propose a neural network model to joint-\nly encode the textual and behavioral information into the review embeddings for the cold-start spam detection task. It is an unsupervised distributional representation model which can learn from large scale unlabeled review data. • Experimental results on two domains (hotel\nand restaurant ) give good confidence that the proposed model performs effectively in the cold-start spam detection task."

(2011) applied psychological and linguistic clues to identify review spam; Harris (2012) explored several writing style features. Syntactic stylometry for review spam detection was investigated in Feng et al. (2012a); Xu and Zhao (2012) using deep linguistic features for finding deceptive opinion spam; Li et al. (2013) studied the topics in the review spam; Li et al. (2014b) further analyzed the general difference of language usage. Fornaciari and Poesio (2014) proved the effectiveness of the N-grams in detecting deceptive Amazon book reviews. The effectiveness of the N-grams was also explored in Cagnina and Rosso (2015). Li et al. (2014a) proposed a positive-unlabeled learning method based on unigrams and bigrams; Kim et al. (2015) carried out a frame-based deep semantic analysis. Hai et al. (2016) exploited the relatedness of multiple review spam detection tasks and available unlabeled data to address the scarcity of labeled opinion spam data by using linguistic features. Besides, (Ren and Zhang, 2016) proved that the CNN model is more effective than the RNN and the traditional discrete manual linguistic features. Hovy (2016) used N-gram generative models to produce reviews and evaluated their effectiveness.\nBehavioral features: Lim et al. (2010) analyzed reviewers’ rating behavioral features; Jindal et al. (2010) identified unusual review patterns which can represent suspicious behaviors of reviews; Li et al. (2011) proposed a two-view semisupervised co-training method base on behavioral features. Feng et al. (2012b) study the distributions of individual spammers’ behaviors. The group spammers’ behavioral features were studied in Mukherjee et al. (2012). Temporal patterns of spammers were investigated by Xie et al. (2012), Fei et al. (2013); Li et al. (2015) explored the temporal and spatial patterns. The review graph was analyzed by Wang et al. (2011), Akoglu et al. (2013); Mukherjee et al. (2013a) studied the spamicity of reviewers. Mukherjee et al. (2013c), Mukherjee et al. (2013b) proved that reviewers’ behavioral features are more effective than reviews’ linguistic features for detecting review spam. Based on this conclusion, recently, researchers (Rayana and Akoglu, 2015; KC and Mukherjee, 2016) have put more efforts in employing reviewers’ behavioral features for detecting review spam, the intuition behind which is to capture the reviewers’ actions and supposes that\nthose reviews written with spammer-like behaviors would be spam. Wang et al. (2016) explored a method to learn the review representation with global behavioral information."

So, we conduct experiments with the word bigrams feature. As shown in Table 1 (a, b) row 1, the word bigrams result in only around 55% in accuracy in both the hotel and restaurant domains.

      "text" : "Abundant Information\nBecause there is not enough available information about the new reviewer, for most traditional behavioral features based on the statistical mechanism, they couldn’t form themselves or make no sense. We investigated the previous work and found that there are three behavioral features can be applied to the cold-start task. They are proposed by Mukherjee et al. (2013b), i.e., 1.Review length (RL) : the length of the new review posted by the new reviewer; 2.Reviewer deviation (RD): the absolute rating deviation of the new reviewer’s review from other reviews on the same business; 3.Maximum content similarity (MCS) : the maximum content similarity (using cosine similarity) between the new reviewer’s review with other reviews on the same business.\nTable 1 (a, b) row 2 shows the experiment results by the combinations of the bigrams feature and the three behavioral features described above. The behavioral features make around 5% improvement in accuracy in the hotel domain (2.7% in the restaurant domain) as compared with only using bigrams. The accuracy is improved but it is just near 60% in average. It indicates that the traditional features are not effective enough with poor behavioral information. What’s more, the behavioral features cause around 4.6% decrease in F1score and around 19% decrease in Recall in both hotel and restaurant domains. It is obvious that there is more false-positive review spam caused by the behavioral features as compared to only using bigrams. It further indicates that the traditional behavioral features’ discrimination for review spam gets to be weakened by the poor behavioral infor-\nmation. To go a step further, we carried experiments with the three behavioral features which are formed on abundant behavioral information. When the new reviewers continue to post more reviews in after weeks, their behavioral information gets to be more. Then the review system could obtain more sufficient data to extract behavior features as compared to the poor information in the cold-start period. So the behavioral features with abundant information make an obvious improvement in accuracy (6.4%) in the hotel domain (Table 1 (a) row 3) as compared with the results in Table 1 (a) row 2. But it is only 0.6% in the restaurant domain. By statistics on the datasets, we found that the new reviewers posted about 54.4 reviews in average after their first post in the hotel domain, but it is only 10 reviews in average for the new reviewers in the restaurant domain. The added behavioral information in the hotel domain is richer than that in the restaurant domain. It indicates that:"

      "text" : "In Figure 1, there is a part of review graph which is simplified from the Yelp website. As it shows, the review graph contains the global behavioral information (footprints) of the existing reviewers. Because the motivations of the spammers and the real reviewers are totally different, the distributions of the behavioral information of them are different (Mukherjee et al., 2013a). There are businesses (even highly reputable ones) paying people to write fake reviews for them to promote their products/services and/or to discredit their competitors (Liu, 2015). So the behavioral footprints of the spammers are decided by the demands of the businesses. But the real reviewers only post reviews to the product or services they have actually experienced. Their behavioral footprints are influenced by their own characteristics. Previous work extracts behavioral features for reviewers from these behavioral information. But it is impractical to the new reviewers in the cold-start task. Moreover, the traditional discrete features can not effectively record the global behavioral information (Wang et al., 2016). Besides, there is no explicit characteristic tag available in the review system, and we need to find a way to record the reviewers’ latent characters information in footprints.\nTherefore we encode these behavioral information into our model by utilizing a embedding learning model which is similar with TransE (Bordes et al., 2013). TransE is a model which can encode the graph structure, and represent the nodes\nand edges (head, translation/relation, tail) in low dimension vector space. TransE has been proved that it is good at describing the global information of the graph structure by the work about distributional representation for knowledge base (Guu et al., 2015). We consider that each reviewer in review graph describes the product in his/her own view and writes the review. When we represent the product, reviewer and review in low dimension vector space, the reviewer embeddings can be taken as a translation vector, which has translated the product embeddings to the review embeddings. So, as shown in Figure 2, we take the products (hotels/restaurants) as the head part of the TransE network in our model, take the reviewers as the translation (relation) part and take the review as the tail part. By learning from the existing large scale unlabeled reviews of the review graph, we can encode the global behavioral information into our model without extracting any traditional behavioral feature, and record reviewers’ latent characteristics information.\nMore formally, we minimize a margin-based criterion over the training set:\nL = ∑\n(β,α,τ )∈S ∑ (β′,α,τ ′)∈S′ max\n{0, 1 + d(β +α, τ )− d(β′ +α, τ ′)} (1)\nS denotes the training set of triples (β,α, τ ) composed product β (β ∈ B, products set (head part)), reviewer α (α ∈ A, reviewers set (translation part)) and review text embeddings learnt by the CNN τ (τ ∈ T , review texts set (tail part)).\nS′ = {(β′,α, τ )|β′ ∈ B} ∪ {(β,α, τ ′)|τ ′ ∈ T} (2)\nThe set of corrupted triplets S′ (Equation (2)), is composed of training triplets with either the product or review text replaced by a random chosen one (but not both at the same time).\nd(β +α, τ ) = ‖β +α− τ‖22 , s.t. ‖β‖22 = ‖α‖ 2 2 = ‖τ‖ 2 2 = 1\n(3)\nd(β + α, τ ) is the dissimilarity function with the squared euclidean distance."

The results are shown in Table 4. For our model, we set the dimension of embeddings to 100, the number of CNN filters to 100, θ to 0.1, Z to 2. The hyper-parameters are tuned by grid search on the development dataset. The product and reviewer embeddings are randomly initialized from a uniform distribution (Socher et al., 2013). The word embeddings are initialized with 100-dimensions vectors pre-trained by the CBOW model (Word2Vec) (Mikolov et al., 2013).As Table 4 showed, our model observably performs better in detecting review spam for the cold-start task in both hotel and restaurant domains.\n7\n601\n602\n603\n604\n605\n606\n607\n608\n609\n610\n611\n612\n613\n614\n615\n616\n617\n618\n619\n620\n621\n622\n623\n624\n625\n626\n627\n628\n629\n630\n631\n632\n633\n634\n635\n636\n637\n638\n639\n640\n641\n642\n643\n644\n645\n646\n647\n648\n649\n650\n651\n652\n653\n654\n655\n656\n657\n658\n659\n660\n661\n662\n663\n664\n665\n666\n667\n668\n669\n670\n671\n672\n673\n674\n675\n676\n677\n678\n679\n680\n681\n682\n683\n684\n685\n686\n687\n688\n689\n690\n691\n692\n693\n694\n695\n696\n697\n698\n699\nFeatures P R F1 A LF 54.5 71.1 61.7 55.9 1\nLF+BF 63.4 52.6 57.5 61.1 2 BF EditSim+LF 55.3 69.7 61.6 56.6 3 BF W2Vsim+W2V 58.4 65.9 61.9 59.5 4 Ours RE 62.1 68.3 65.1 63.3 5 Ours RE+RRE+PRE 63.6 71.2 67.2 65.4 6 (a) Hotel\nP R F1 A 53.8 80.8 64.6 55.8 1 58.1 61.2 59.6 58.5 2 53.9 82.2 65.1 56.0 3 56.3 73.4 63.7 58.2 4 58.4 75.1 65.7 60.8 5 59.0 78.8 67.5 62.0 6\n(b) Restaurant\nTable 4: SVM classification results across linguistic features (LF, bigrams here (Mukherjee et al., 2013b)), behavioral features (BF: RL, RD, MCS (Mukherjee et al., 2013b)); the SVM classification results by the intuitive method that finding the most similar existing review by edit distance ratio and take the found reviewers’ behavioral features as approximation (BF EditSim+LF), and results by the intuitive method that finding the most similar existing review by averaged pre-trained word embeddings (using Word2Vec) (BF W2Vsim+W2V); and the SVM classification results across the learnt review embeddings (RE), the learnt review’s rating embeddings (RRE), the learnt product’s average rating embeddings (PRE) by our model. Improvements of our model are statistically significant with p<0.005 based on paired t-test.\nReview Embeddings Compared with the traditional linguistic features, e.g., bigrams, using the review embeddings learnt by our model, results in around 3.4% improvement in F1 and around 7.4% improvement in A in the hotel domain (1.1% in F1 and 5.0% in A for the restaurant domain, shown in Tabel 4 (a,b) rows 1, 5). Compared with the combination of the bigrams and the traditional behavioral features, using the review embeddings learnt by our model, results in around 7.6% improvement in F1 and around 2.2% improvement in A in the hotel domain (6.1% in F1 and 2.3% in A for the restaurant domain, shown in Tabel 4 (a,b) rows 2, 5). The F1-Score (F1) of the classification under the balance distribution reflects the ability of detecting the review spam. The accuracy (A) of the classification under the balance distribution reflects the ability of identifying both the review spam and the real review. The experiment results indicate that our model performs significantly better than the traditional methods in F1 and A at the same time. The learnt review embeddings with encoded linguistic and behavioral information are more effective in detecting review spam for the cold-start task. Rating Embeddings As we referred in Section 4.3, the rating of a review usually means the sentiment polarity of a real reviewer or the motivation of a spammer. As shown in Table 4 (a,b) rows 6, adding the rating embeddings of the products (hotel/restaurant) and reviews renders even higher F1 and A. We suppose that different rating embeddings are encoded with different semantic meanings. They reflect the semantic divergences be-\ntween the average rating of the product and the review rating. In results, using RE+RRE+PRE which makes the best performance of our model, results in around 5.5% improvement in F1 and around 9.5% improvement in A in the hotel domain (2.9% in F1 and 6.2% in A for the restaurant domain, shown in Tabel 4 (a,b) rows 1, 6), compared with the LF. Using RE+RRE+PRE results in around 9.7% improvement in F1 and around 4.3% improvement in A in the hotel domain (7.9% in F1 and 3.5% in A for the restaurant domain, shown in Tabel 4 (a,b) rows 2, 6), compared with the LF+BF.\nThe experiment results proves that our model is effective. The improvements in both the F1 and A prove that our model performs well in both detecting the review spam and identifying the real review. Furthermore, the improvements in both the hotel and restaurant domains prove that our model possesses preferable domain-adaptability 2. It can learn to represent the reviews with global linguistic and behavioral information from large scale unlabeled existing reviews."

Then, a classifier is applied to detect the review spam. Experimental results prove the proposed model achieves an effective performance and possesses preferable domain-adaptability.

Most efforts are devoted to explore effective linguistic and behavioral features by subsequent work to distinguish such spam from the real reviews. However, to notice such patterns or form behavioral features, developers should take long time to observe the data, because the features are based on statistics. For instance, the feature activity window proposed by Mukherjee et al. (2013c) is to measure the activity freshness of reviewers. It usually takes several months to count the difference of timestamps between the last and first reviews for reviewers. When the features show themselves finally, some major damages might have already been done. Thus, it is important to design algorithms that can detect review spam as soon as possible, ideally, right after they are posted by the new reviewers. It is a coldstart problem which is the focus of this paper. In this paper, we assume that we must identify fake reviews immediately when a new reviewer posts just one review. Unfortunately, it is very difficult because the available information for detecting fake reviews is very poor. Traditional behavioral features based on the statistics can only work well on users’ abundant behaviors. The more behavioral information obtained, the more effective the traditional behavioral features are (see experiments in Section 3 ). In the scenario of cold-start, a new reviewer only has a behavior: post a review. As a result, we can not get effective behavioral features from the data. Although, the linguistic features of reviews do not need to take much time to form, Mukherjee et al. (2013c) have proved that the linguistic features are not effective enough in detecting real-life fake reviews from the commercial websites, where we also obtain the same observation (the details are shown in Section 3).",

This paper proposes a novel neural network model to detect review spam for cold-start problem, by learning to represent the new reviewers’ review with jointly embedded textual and behavioral information. Experimental results prove the proposed model achieves an effective performance and possesses preferable domain-adaptability. It is also applicable to a large scale dataset in an unsupervised way.",
