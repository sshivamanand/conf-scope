      "text" : "Discourse rarely exists isolated, so the interpretation of a discourse requires understanding of its structure and semantics. (De Beaugrande, 1981) As an instance, the discourse primary-secondary relationship is the relation between the primary content and secondary content within a discourse, or the relation between the primary and secondary aspects of a discourse and the others. Here, the primary content refers to the dominant position in the discourse, and plays a decisive role in the part, while the secondary content refers to the auxiliary position, and does not play a decisive role in the discourse.\nIn principle, the primary-secondary relationship\nplays a critical role in natural language processing, since the recognition of the discourse primarysecondary relationship not only helps to understand the discourse structure and semantics, but also provides strong support for deep natural language processing applications. Despite of its potential in statistical machine translation (Meyer and Popescu-Belis, 2012; Guzmán et al., 2014; Peldszus and Stede, 2015), automatic text summarization (Atkinson and Munoz, 2013; Ferreira et al., 2014; Cohan and Goharian, 2015), question answering (Liakata et al., 2013), information extraction (Presutti et al., 2012; Zou et al., 2014), sentiment analysis (Mukherjee et al., 2012; Mittal et al., 2013; Bhatia et al., 2015) etc. recognition of the discourse primary-secondary relationship has become the bottleneck in discourse structure analysis recently, largely due to the ignorance of its critical role in discourse structure analysis by viewing it only as a dispensable component in the analysis of the discourse rhetorical structure.\nGenerally speaking, there exist two hierarchical levels of discourse structures: micro level and macro level. While micro structure refers to the relationship between the internal structures in a sentence or two consecutive sentences, the macro structure refers to the relationship between sentences, paragraphs and chapters, at a higher level.\nAt the micro level, the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1987), one of the most influential discourse theories, represents the discourse structure as a tree with phrases or clauses as elementary units(EDUs), where adjacent EDUs are connected by rhetorical relations, forming larger discourse units. Although RST establishes two different types of units, where nucleus are considered as the central parts, and satellites as peripheral ones. The nuclearity defined in RST is considered from the particular rhetorical relation, instead of the overall discourse, and with-\n2\n101\n102\n103\n104\n105\n106\n107\n108\n109\n110\n111\n112\n113\n114\n115\n116\n117\n118\n119\n120\n121\n122\n123\n124\n125\n126\n127\n128\n129\n130\n131\n132\n133\n134\n135\n136\n137\n138\n139\n140\n141\n142\n143\n144\n145\n146\n147\n148\n149\n150\n151\n152\n153\n154\n155\n156\n157\n158\n159\n160\n161\n162\n163\n164\n165\n166\n167\n168\n169\n170\n171\n172\n173\n174\n175\n176\n177\n178\n179\n189\n190\n191\n192\n193\n194\n195\n196\n197\n198\n199\nout considering the overall discourse intention, the nuclearity is difficult to distinguish.\nAt the macro level, Van Dijk (1980) proposes the macrostructure theory, indicating that a text not only has local or microstructure relationship between subsequent sentences, but also has overall structure that defines their global coherence and organization. Although Van Dijk explores the macrostructure from both semantics and pragmatics, he focuses on the semantic aspect of the macrostructure, emphasizing that without the semantic macrostructure, it is unable to explain the meaning of the overall discourse and understand the partial coherence in the macrostructure. Unfortunately, no matter whether at micro level or at macro level, existing theories focus on logical semantics, with few from the pragmatic function perspective.\nIn this paper, we regard the recognition of primary-secondary relationship as an independent task from the discourse rhetorical structure analysis, and integrate the overall discourse with the primary-secondary relationship as the unified carrier. For this purpose, a macro discourse structure representation schema is proposed. At the micro level, we lay on the logical semantic relationship between the discourse units based on the rhetorical structure, while at the macro level, we lay on the pragmatic function of the content based on the schematic structure. Specifically, our work expands the discourse analysis from intra-paragraph to the overall discourse. Guided by the representation schema, we annotate 97 news wire articles both from the perspective of micro semantics and macro pragmatics. Table 1 compares the macro and micro structures. Preliminary experiments on the recognition of discourse relation and primarysecondary relation show that our macro-micro unified representation schema is appropriate for the discourse structure analysis tasks."

      "text" : "From micro perspective, discourse structure theories mainly include Cohesion Theory(Halliday, 1971), Hobbs Model(Hobbs, 1993, 1979), Rhetor-\nical Structure Theory(Mann and Thompson, 1986, 1987; Mann et al., 1992), Intention Structure Theory (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Grosz et al., 1995), Chinese Complex Sentences Theory (Xing, 2001; Yao, 2006), Connective-driven Dependency Tree Theory (Li, 2015; Li et al., 2014) etc. From macro perspective, the theories of discourse structure are relatively few, including Super-theme Theory (Martin and Rose, 2003), Macrostructures Theory (Van Dijk, 1980, 1985, 2013) etc.\nCohesion Theory: Halliday (1971) pointed out in cohesion theory, “cohesion considers the interaction of cohesion with other aspects of text organization.” When Grimes (1975) depended the cohesion theory, he identified two types of functional relations: 1) paratactic, where all parts of a relation are equally prominent in terms of their discoursal functions; and 2) hypotactic, where one part of a relation is more prominent than the other part.\nRhetorical Structure Theory: RST (Mann and Thompson, 1986) provides a general way to describe the relations among the elementary discourse units, and establishes two different types of units, nucleus and satellite. Nuclei are considered as the most important parts of text whereas satellites contribute to the nuclei and are secondary. Figure 1 shows the rhetorical structure of three types of rhetorical relation: (a) evidence; (b) circumstance; and (c) sequence. The arrows point to the nuclei in the structure.\nConnective-driven Dependency Tree: Li et al. (2014) proposed a Connective-driven Dependency Tree(CDT) scheme to represent discourse rhetorical structure, with EDUs as leaf nodes and connectives as non-leaf nodes, to accommodate the special characteristics of Chinese language. A discourse can be expressed to a complete discourse structure tree based on the CDT representation schema.\n3\n201\n202\n203\n204\n205\n206\n207\n208\n209\n210\n211\n212\n213\n214\n215\n216\n217\n218\n219\n220\n221\n222\n223\n224\n225\n226\n227\n228\n229\n230\n231\n232\n233\n234\n235\n236\n237\n238\n239\n240\n241\n242\n243\n244\n245\n246\n247\n248\n249\n250\n251\n252\n253\n254\n255\n256\n257\n258\n259\n260\n261\n262\n263\n264\n265\n266\n267\n275\n276\n277\n278\n279\n280\n281\n282\n283\n284\n285\n286\n287\n288\n289\n290\n291\n292\n293\n294\n295\n296\n297\n298\n299\nPerspective Structure Concern Description Micro Rhetorical Structure Logical semantics Structural analysis from the form Macro Schematic Structure Functional Pragmatics Functional analysis from the information\nTable 1: Comparison of micro and macro structures\nMacrostructure Theory: The point of macrostructures is that texts not only have local or micro structural relations between subsequent sentences, but also have overall structures that define their global coherence and organization (Van Dijk, 1980).

Two probabilistic models were employed that use syntactic and lexical information to segment and parse text. LeThanh et al. (2004) proposed a multi-step algorithm to segment text and organize the spans into trees for each successive level of text organization. Hernault et al. (2010) presented HILDA, an implemented discourse parser by combining adjacent spans with\ngreedy bottom-up tree building approach, they built discourse trees in linear time complexity with respect to the length of the input text. Joty et al. (2013) built a discourse tree by applying an optimal parsing algorithm to probabilities inferred from two Conditional Random Fields: one for intra-sentential parsing and the other for multisentential parsing. The performance of the algorithms we mentioned above is shown in Table 2.\nOn the contrast of the researches at the micro level, very few corpus resources and computational models are proposed at the macro level."

There are two main parts in the structure: summary and story. Summary contains headline and lead, while story includes situation and comments, and all these parts together constitute the macrostructure of news discourse through a top-down hierarchical structure. Such a schematic structure allows readers to quickly analyze and understand the discourse function in the communicative situation.\nInspired by Van Dijk’s schematic structure, we unify the primary-secondary relationship which defined in RST (nuclearity) and macrostructure separately, and combine the micro and macro discourse structure together, and then explore a Macro Discourse structure representation schema. In this representation schema, discourse structure tree is represented the hierarchical discourse(as shown in Figure 4). We construct a top-down structure with multiple layers, composed of title, chapter, paragraph, microstructure, and elementary discourse unit. In general, there is only one layer of the title and the chapter, while the other structural layers are composed of multiple layers. The arrow direction indicates the primary unit of discourse relation. For the microstructure, we follow the definition of CDT, which not expanded in the Figure 4.\nWe expand the discourse analysis from intraparagraph to the overall discourse on the basis of original discourse structure analysis. At the micro level, we analyze the logical semantic relationship between the discourse units based on the rhetorical structure; at the macro level, we ana-\nlyze the function of the discourse content based on the schematic structure. Guided by this representation, we take the genre of news wire as the main research object, and annotate 97 news wire articles both from the perspective of micro semantics and macro pragmatics.\nFor example, in the case of magazine article chtb 0596 from Chinese Treebank 8.0, the macro schematic structure and the micro rhetorical structure of our annotation are shown in figure 5 and figure 6. In schematic structure, we annotate the function of each paragraph and unit group, while in rhetorical structure we focus on the rhetorical relation between discourse units."

For instance, in statementillustration relation, one of the discourse units is statement, while the other is illustration, the illustration unit is a service for the statement, so the statement-illustration relation is P-S relation; another example, in joint relation, there can be two or more discourse units, one or more discourse units may act as primary parts, so joint relation may be a P-S or S-P or MP relation.\nFrom the micro perspective, the primarysecondary relationship represents the relation between sentences or sentence groups, while from the macro perspective, the primary-secondary relationship represents the relation between paragraphs, chapters or discourses.\nIn the discourse structure tree shown in Figure 7, the arrows point to the primary units in the discourse. In this discourse, paragraph 2 introduces the approval and development situation of Ningbo free trade zone, which is the background of the event Ningbo free trade zone has achieved fruitful results mentioned in paragraph\n1. These two paragraphs constitute a background relation, in which paragraph 1 is a primary unit, and paragraph 2 is a secondary unit according to the content. Paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 respectively from the three aspects expounds the fruitful results mentioned in paragraph 1, the discourse relation among them is joint, and all the three paragraphs constitute a whole unit, explain the overall structure constituted by paragraph 1 and 2, the two paragraph groups form the relation of elaboration, in which the paragraph 1 and 2 is more important. In the overall discourse, paragraph 1 can best express the discourse topic Significant achievements in the construction of Ningbo Free Trade Zone (also the discourse title), paragraph 1 is therefore the most important paragraph among all these discourse units.

(1) We determine the overall level first and then analysis goes on step by step to the individual discourse units. Such a top-down strategy can easily grasp the overall discourse structure, which consistent with the reading habit of human beings. (2) Meanwhile, we determine whether the lower discourse units need to be combined first according to the similarity of their forms and contents, and combine them together as a whole unit to contact with other parts. Our annotation work shows the strategy is effective."

A 10 fold cross validation method is adopted, in which sample set is divided into 10 parts of equal size, 9 of them as training set, the remaining one as test set, and different part is selected as test set each time, repeat the exercise 10 times, the average of the 10 results is used to estimate the model performance.\nAll our classifiers are trained using nltk package with default parameters, and experimented with maximum entropy classifier.

      "text" : "In this paper, we focus on the problem of discourse primary-secondary relationship whose importance is totally ignored in recent studies. We explore to recognize the primary-secondary relationship which plays a critical role in discourse structure analysis, and view it as an independent task from the discourse rhetorical structure analysis.\nIn particular, we expand the discourse structure analysis from intra-paragraph to the overall discourse, and propose a macro-micro unified discourse structure representation scheme, and describe the scheme in detail. We also annotate 97 news wire articles based on the representation schema we defined. Evaluation of the corpus resource on discourse relation recognition and primary-secondary relation recognition justifies the effectiveness of the representation schema and corpus resource. In the future work, we will enlarge the scale of the corpus and explore the various discourse patterns.\n9\n801\n802\n803\n804\n805\n806\n807\n808\n809\n810\n811\n812\n813\n814\n815\n816\n817\n818\n819\n820\n821\n822\n823\n824\n825\n826\n827\n828\n829\n830\n831\n832\n833\n834\n835\n836\n837\n838\n839\n840\n841\n842\n843\n844\n845\n846\n847\n848\n849\n850\n851\n852\n853\n854\n855\n856\n857\n858\n859\n860\n861\n862\n863\n864\n865\n866\n867\n868\n869\n870\n871\n872\n873\n874\n875\n876\n877\n878\n879\n880\n881\n882\n883\n884\n885\n886\n887\n888\n889\n890\n891\n892\n893\n894\n895\n896\n897\n898\n899"

In this paper, after studying the difference and the relationship between micro and macro discourse structures, we explore the macro discourse structure, and put forward a Macro Chinese Discourse Treebank (MCDTB) on the top of existing Chinese Discourse Treebank (CDTB), by unifying micro and macro discourse structures. Specifically, at the micro level, we put forward the primary-secondary relationship from the logical semantic perspective, while at the macro level, we put forward the primarysecondary relationship from the pragmatic function perspective. Preliminary experimentation shows that our macro-micro unified schema is appropriate for the discourse structure analysis.",
