      "text" : "Sentence summarization aims to shorten a given sentence and produce a brief summary of it. This is different from document level summarization task since it is hard to apply existing techniques in extractive methods, such as extracting sentence level features and ranking sentences. Early works propose using rule-based methods (Zajic et al., 2007), syntactic tree pruning methods (Knight and Marcu, 2002), statistical machine translation techniques (Banko et al., 2000) and so on for this task. We focus on abstractive sentence summarization task in this paper.\nRecently, neural network models have been applied in this task. Rush et al. (2015) use autoconstructed sentence-headline pairs to train a neural network summarization model. They use a\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) encoder and feed-forward neural network language model decoder for this task. Chopra et al. (2016) extend their work by replacing the decoder with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Nallapati et al. (2016) follow this line and change the encoder to RNN to make it a full RNN based sequence-tosequence model (Sutskever et al., 2014).\nAll the above works fall into the encodingdecoding paradigm, which first encodes the input sentence to an abstract representation and then decodes the intended output sentence based on the encoded information. As an extension of the encoding-decoding framework, attentionbased approach (Bahdanau et al., 2015) has been broadly used: the encoder produces a list of vectors for all tokens in the input, and the decoder uses an attention mechanism to dynamically extract encoded information and align with the output tokens. This approach achieves huge success in tasks like neural machine translation, where alignment between all parts of the input and output are required. However, in abstractive sentence summarization, there is no explicit alignment relationship between input sentence and the summary except for the extracted common words. The\n2\n101\n102\n103\n104\n105\n106\n107\n108\n109\n110\n111\n112\n113\n114\n115\n116\n117\n118\n119\n120\n121\n122\n123\n124\n125\n126\n127\n128\n129\n130\n131\n132\n133\n134\n135\n136\n137\n138\n139\n140\n141\n142\n143\n144\n145\n146\n147\n148\n149\n150\n151\n152\n153\n154\n162\n163\n164\n165\n166\n167\n168\n169\n170\n171\n172\n173\n174\n175\n176\n177\n178\n179\n180\n181\n182\n183\n184\n185\n186\n187\n188\n189\n190\n191\n192\n193\n194\n195\n196\n197\n198\n199\nchallenge here is not to infer the alignment, but to select the highlights while filtering out secondary information in the input. A desired work-flow for abstractive sentence summarization is encoding, selection, and decoding. After selecting the important information from an encoded sentence, the decoder produces the output summary using the selected information. For example, in Figure 1, given the input sentence, the summarization system first selects the important information, and then rephrases or paraphrases to produce a well-organized summary. Although this is implicitly modeled in the encoding-decoding framework, we argue that abstractive sentence summarization shall benefit from explicitly modeling this selection process.\nIn this paper we propose Selective Encoding for Abstractive Sentence Summarization (SEASS). We treat the sentence summarization as a threephase task: encoding, selection, and decoding. It consists of a sentence encoder, a selective gate network, and a summary decoder. First, the sentence encoder reads the input words through an RNN unit to construct the first level sentence representation. Then the selective gate network selects the encoded information to construct the second level sentence representation. The selective mechanism controls the information flow from encoder to decoder by applying a gate network according to the sentence information, which helps improve encoding effectiveness and release the burden of the decoder. Finally, the attention-equipped decoder generates the summary using the second level sentence representation. We conduct experiments on English Gigaword, DUC 2004 and Microsoft Research Abstractive Text Compression test sets. Our SEASS model achieves 17.54 ROUGE-2 F1, 9.56 ROUGE-2 recall and 10.63 ROUGE-2 F1 on these test sets respectively, which improves performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods."

      "heading" : "3.2 Selective Mechanism",
      "text" : "In the sequence-to-sequence machine translation (MT) model, the encoder and decoder are responsible for encoding input sentence information and decoding the sentence representation to generate an output sentence. Some previous works apply this framework to summarization generation tasks. However, abstractive sentence summarization is different from MT in two ways. First, there is no explicit alignment relationship between the input sentence and the output summary except for the common words. Second, summarization task needs to keep the highlights and remove the unnecessary information, while MT needs to keep all information literally.\nHerein, we propose a selective mechanism to model the selection process for abstractive sentence summarization. The selective mechanism extends the sequence-to-sequence model by constructing a tailored representation for abstractive sentence summarization task. Concretely, the selective gate network in our model takes two vector\ninputs, the sentence word vector hi and the sentence representation vector s. The sentence word vector hi is the output of the BiGRU encoder and represents the meaning and context information of word xi. The sentence vector s is used to represent the meaning of the sentence. For each word xi, the selective gate network generates a gate vector sGatei using hi and s, then the tailored representation is constructed, i.e., h′i.\nIn detail, we concatenate the last forward hidden state ~hn and backward hidden state ~h1 as the sentence representation s:\ns =\n[ ~h1\n~hn\n] (7)\nFor each time step i, the select gate takes the sentence representation s and BiGRU hidden hi as inputs to compute the select gate sGatei:\nsGatei = σ(Wshi +Uss+ b) h′i = hi sGatei (8) (9)\nwhere σ is sigmoid activation function and is element-wise multiplication. After the selective gate network, we obtain another sequence of vectors (h′1, h ′ 2, . . . , h ′ n). This new sequence is then used as the input sentence representation for the decoder to generate the summary."

The parallel corpus is produced by pairing the first sentence and the headline in the news article with some heuristic rules. We use the script1 released by Rush et al. (2015) to pre-process and extract the training and development datasets. The script performs various basic text normalization, including PTB tokenization, lower-casing, replacing all digit characters with #, and replacing word types seen less than 5 times with 〈unk〉. The extracted corpus contains about 3.8M sentence-summary pairs for the training set and 189K examples for the development set.\nFor our test set, we use the English Gigaword, DUC 2004, and Microsoft Research Abstractive Text Compression test sets.\nEnglish Gigaword Test Set We randomly sample 8000 pairs from the extracted development set as our development set since it is relatively large. For the test set, we use the same randomly heldout test set of 2000 sentence-summary pairs as Rush et al. (2015).2\nWe also find that except for the empty titles, this test set has some invalid lines like the input sentence containing only one word. Therefore, we further sample 2000 pairs as our internal test set and release it for future works.\nDUC 2004 Test Set We employ DUC 2004 data for tasks 1 & 2 (Over et al., 2007) in our experiments as one of the test sets since it is too small to train a neural network model on.

(2015). RG in the Table denotes ROUGE. Results with ‡ mark are taken from the corresponding papers. The supper script - indicates that our SEASS model with beam search performs significantly better than it as given by the 95% confidence interval in the official ROUGE script.\nIn Table 3, we report the ROUGE F1 score of our model and the baseline methods. Our SEASS model with beam search outperforms all baseline models by a large margin. Even for greedy search, our model still performs better than other methods\n3http://www.berouge.com/ 4The ROUGE evaluation option is the same as Rush et al.\n(2015), -m -n 2 -w 1.2 5The ROUGE evaluation option is, -m -n 2 -w 1.2 6The ROUGE evaluation option is, -m -b 75 -n 2 -w 1.2\nwhich used beam search. For the popular ROUGE2 metric, our SEASS model achieves 17.54 F1 score and performs better than the previous works. Compared to the ABS model, our model has a 6.22 ROUGE-2 F1 relative gain. Compared to the highest CAs2s baseline, our model achieves 1.75 ROUGE-2 F1 improvement and passes the significant test according to the official ROUGE script.\nTable 4 summarizes our results on our internal test set using ROUGE F1 evaluation metrics. The performance on our internal test set is comparable to our development set, which achieves 24.58 ROUGE-2 F1 and outperforms the baselines.\nDUC 2004 We evaluate our model using the ROUGE recall score since the reference summaries\n7\n601\n602\n603\n604\n605\n606\n607\n608\n609\n610\n611\n612\n613\n614\n615\n616\n617\n618\n619\n620\n621\n622\n623\n624\n625\n626\n627\n628\n629\n630\n631\n632\n633\n634\n635\n636\n637\n638\n639\n640\n641\n642\n643\n644\n645\n646\n647\n648\n649\n662\n663\n664\n665\n666\n667\n668\n669\n670\n671\n672\n673\n674\n675\n676\n677\n678\n679\n680\n681\n682\n683\n684\n685\n686\n687\n688\n689\n690\n691\n692\n693\n694\n695\n696\n697\n698\n699\nof the DUC 2004 test set are capped at 75 bytes. Therefore, we decode the summary to a fixed length 18 to ensure that the generated summary satisfies the minimum length requirement. As summarized in Table 5, our SEASS outperforms all the baseline methods and achieves 29.21, 9.56 and 25.51 for ROUGE 1, 2 and L recall. Compared to the ABS+ model which is tuned using DUC 2003 data, our model performs significantly better by 1.07 ROUGE-2 recall score and is trained only with English Gigaword sentence-summary data without being tuned using DUC data.\nMSR-ATC We report the full length ROUGE F1 score on the MSR-ATC test set in Table 6. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that reports ROUGE metric scores on the MSR-ATC dataset. Note that we only compare our model with ABS since the others are not publicly available. Our SEASS achieves 10.63 ROUGE-2 F1 and outperforms the s2s+att baseline by 1.02 points.\nModels RG-1 RG-2 RG-L\nABS (beam) 20.27- 5.26- 17.10- s2s+att (greedy) 15.15- 4.48- 13.62- s2s+att (beam) 22.65- 9.61- 21.39- SEASS (greedy) 19.77 6.44 17.36 SEASS (beam) 25.75 10.63 22.90\nTable 6: Full length ROUGE F1 evaluation on MSR-ATC test set.

      "text" : "In this section, we first compare the performance of SEASS with the s2s+att baseline model to illustrate that the proposed method succeeds in selecting information and building tailored representation for abstractive sentence summarization. We then analyze selective encoding by visualizing the heat map.\nEffectiveness of Selective Encoding We further test the SEASS model with different sentence lengths on English Gigaword test sets, which are merged from the Rush et al. (2015) test set and our internal test set. The length of sentences in the test sets ranges from 10 to 80. We group the sentences\nwith an interval of 4 and get 18 different groups and we draw the first 14 groups. We find that the performance curve of our SEASS model always appears to be on the top of that of s2s+att with a certain margin. For the groups of 16, 20, 24, 32, 56 and 60, the SEASS model obtains big improvements compared to the s2s+att model. Overall, these improvements on all groups indicate that the selective encoding method benefits the abstractive sentence summarization task.\nSaliency Heat Map of Selective Gate Since the output of the selective gate network is a high dimension vector, it is hard to visualize all the gate values. We use the method in Li et al. (2016) to visualize the contribution of the selective gate to the final output, which can be approximated by the first derivative. Given sentence words x with associated output summary y, the trained model associates the pair (x, y) with a score Sy(x). The goal is to decide which gate g associated with x makes the most significant contribution to Sy(x). We approximate the Sy(g) by computing the first-order Taylor expansion\nSy(g) ≈ ∂(Sy)\n∂g g + b (19)\nWe then draw the Euclidean norm of the first derivative of the output y with respect to the selective gate g associated with each input words.\nFigure 4 shows an example of the first derivative heat map, in which most of the important words are selected by the selective gate such as “europe”, “slammed”, “unacceptable”, “conditions”,\n8\n701\n702\n703\n704\n705\n706\n707\n708\n709\n710\n711\n712\n713\n714\n715\n716\n717\n718\n719\n720\n721\n722\n723\n724\n725\n726\n727\n728\n729\n730\n731\n732\n733\n734\n735\n736\n737\n738\n739\n740\n741\n742\n743\n744\n745\n746\n747\n748\n749\n750\n751\n752\n753\n754\n755\n756\n757\n758\n759\n760\n761\n762\n763\n764\n765\n766\n767\n768\n769\n770\n771\n772\n773\n774\n775\n776\n777\n778\n779\n780\n781\n782\n783\n784\n785\n786\n787\n788\n789\n790\n791\n792\n793\n794\n795\n796\n797\n798\n799\nth e co u n ci\nl\no f e u ro\np e\n's h u m\na n\nri g h ts co m\nm is\nsi o n e r\nsl a m\nm e d\nth u rs\nd a y\na s `` u n a cc\ne p ta\nb le\n'' co n d it\nio n s\nin fr a n ce 's o v e rc\nro w\nd e d\na n d d ila\np id\na te\nd\nja ils , w h e re so m e # # in m\na te\ns\nh a v e co m\nm it\nte d\nsu ic\nid e\nth is y e a r .\nFigure 4: First derivative heat map of the output with respect to the selective gate.

We can observe that the selective gate determines the importance of each word before decoder, which releases the burden of it by providing tailored sentence encoding."

      "text" : "Abstractive sentence summarization, also known as sentence compression and similar to headline generation, is used to help compress or fuse the selected sentences in extractive document summarization systems since they may inadvertently include unnecessary information. There are some previous methods to solve this task, such as the linguistic rule-based method (Dorr et al., 2003). As for the statistical machine learning based methods, Banko et al. (2000) apply statistical machine translation techniques by modeling headline generation as a translation task and use 8000 article-headline pairs to train the system.\nRush et al. (2015) propose leveraging news data in Annotated English Gigaword (Napoles et al., 2012) corpus to construct large scale parallel data for sentence summarization task. They propose an ABS model, which consists of an attentive Convolutional Neural Network encoder and an neural network language model (Bengio et al., 2003) decoder. Chopra et al. (2016) extend this work, which keeps the CNN encoder but replaces the decoder with recurrent neural networks. Nallapati et al. (2016) further change the encoder to an RNN encoder, which leads to a full RNN sequence-tosequence model. Besides, they enrich the encoder with lexical and statistic features which play important roles in traditional feature based summarization systems, such as NER and POS tags, to improve performance. Experiments on the Gigaword and DUC 2004 test sets show that the above models achieve state-of-the-art results.\nGu et al. (2016) and Gulcehre et al. (2016) come up similar ideas that summarization task can\nbenefit from copying words from input sentences. Gu et al. (2016) propose CopyNet to model the copying action in response generation, which also applies for summarization task. Gulcehre et al. (2016) propose a switch gate to control whether to copy from source or generate from decoder vocabulary. Zeng et al. (2016) also propose using copy mechanism and add an extra gate on the GRU/LSTM gate for this task. Cheng and Lapata (2016) use an RNN based encoder-decoder for extractive summarization of documents\nYu et al. (2016) propose a segment to segment neural transduction model for sequence-tosequence framework. The model introduces a latent segmentation which determines correspondences between tokens of the input sequence and the output sequence. Shen et al. (2016) propose applying Minimum Risk Training (MRT) in NMT to directly optimize the evaluation metrics. Ayana et al. (2016) apply MRT on abstractive sentence summarization task and the results show that optimizing for ROUGE improves the test performance."

      "heading" : "7 Conclusion",
      "text" : "This paper proposes a selective encoding model which extends the sequence-to-sequence model for abstractive sentence summarization task. The selective mechanism mimics one of the human summarizers’ behaviors, selecting important information before writing down the summary. With the proposed selective mechanism, we build an end-to-end neural network summarization model which consists of three phases: encoding, selection, and decoding. Experimental results show that the selective encoding model greatly improves the performance with respect to the state-of-theart methods on English Gigaword, DUC 2004 and MSR-ATC test sets.\n9\n801\n802\n803\n804\n805\n806\n807\n808\n809\n810\n811\n812\n813\n814\n815\n816\n817\n818\n819\n820\n821\n822\n823\n824\n825\n826\n827\n828\n829\n830\n831\n832\n833\n834\n835\n836\n837\n838\n839\n840\n841\n842\n843\n844\n845\n846\n847\n848\n849\n850\n851\n852\n853\n854\n855\n856\n857\n858\n859\n860\n861\n862\n863\n864\n865\n866\n867\n868\n869\n870\n871\n872\n873\n874\n875\n876\n877\n878\n879\n880\n881\n882\n883\n884\n885\n886\n887\n888\n889\n890\n891\n892\n893\n894\n895\n896\n897\n898\n899"

It consists of a sentence encoder, a selective gate network, and an attention equipped decoder. The sentence encoder and decoder are built with recurrent neural networks. The selective gate network constructs a second level sentence representation by controlling the information flow from encoder to decoder. The second level representation is tailored for sentence summarization task, which leads to better performance. We evaluate our model on the English Gigaword, DUC 2004 and MSR abstractive sentence summarization datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed selective encoding model outperforms the state-ofthe-art baseline models.",
