      "text" : "A major goal of natural language processing (NLP) is to develop agents that can understand natural language. Such an ability can be tested with a reading comprehension (RC) task that requires the agent to read open-domain documents and answer questions about them. Building the RC ability is challenging because RC comprises multiple processes including parsing, understanding cohesion, and inference with linguistic and general knowledge.\nClarifying what a system achieves is important to the development of RC systems. To achieve robust improvement, systems need to be measured according to various metrics, not just simple accuracy. However, a current problem is that most RC datasets are presented only with superficial categories, such as question types (e.g., what, where, and who) and answer types (e.g., numeric, location, and person). In addition, Chen et al. (2016) revealed that some questions in datasets may not\nhave the quality to test RC systems. In these situations, it is difficult to assess systems accurately.\nAs Norvig (1989) stated, questions easy for humans often turn out to be difficult for systems. For example, see the two RC questions in Figure 1. In the first example from SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), although the document is taken from a Wikipedia article and is thus written for adults, the question is easy to solve simply look at one sentence and select an entity. On the other hand, in the second example from MCTest (Richardson et al., 2013), the document is written for children and is easy to read, but the question requires reading multiple sentences and a combination of several skills, such as understanding of causal relations (Sara wanted... → they went to...), coreference resolution (Sara and Her Dad = they), and complementing ellipsis (baseball team = team). These two examples show that the readability of the text does not necessarily correlate with the difficulty of the questions. Nevertheless, the accompanying categories of existing RC datasets cannot\n2\n101\n102\n103\n104\n105\n106\n107\n108\n109\n110\n111\n112\n113\n114\n115\n116\n117\n118\n119\n120\n121\n122\n123\n124\n125\n126\n127\n128\n129\n130\n131\n132\n133\n134\n135\n136\n137\n138\n139\n140\n141\n142\n143\n144\n145\n146\n147\n148\n149\n150\n151\n152\n153\n154\n155\n156\n157\n158\n159\n160\n161\n162\n163\n164\n165\n166\n167\n168\n169\n170\n171\n172\n173\n174\n175\n176\n177\n178\n179\n180\n181\n182\n183\n184\n185\n186\n187\n188\n189\n190\n191\n192\n193\n194\n195\n196\n197\n198\n199\nprovide any way to analyze this issue.\nIn this study, our goal was to investigate how the two difficulties of “answering questions” and “reading text” relate in RC. Therefore, we adopted two classes of evaluation metrics for RC datasets to analyze both the quality of datasets and the performance of systems. Our paper is divided into the following sections. First, we adopt the two classes: prerequisite skills and readability (Section 3). We then specify evaluation metrics for each (Sections 3.1 and 3.2). Next, we annotate six existing RC datasets with these metrics (Section 4). Finally, we present our annotation results (Section 5) and discuss them (Section 6).\nOur two classes of metrics are based on McNamara and Magliano (2009)’s analysis of human text comprehension in psychology. The first class defines the difficulty of comprehending the context to answer questions. We adopted prerequisite skills proposed in a previous study by Sugawara et al. (2017). That study presented an important observation of the relation between the difficulty of an RC task and prerequisite skills: the more skills that are required to answer a question, the more difficult the question is. From this observation, we assume that the number of required skills corresponds to the difficulty of a question. This is because each skill corresponds to a function of a system, which has to be equipped with the system. However, a problem in previous studies, including that of Sugawara and Aizawa (2016), is that they analyzed only two datasets and that their categorization of knowledge reasoning is provisional with a weak theoretical background.\nTherefore, we reorganized the category of knowledge reasoning in terms of textual entailment and human text comprehension. In research on textual entailment, several methodologies have been proposed for precise analysis of entailment phenomena (Dagan et al., 2013; LoBue and Yates, 2011). In psychology research, Kintsch (1993) proposed dichotomies for the classification of human inferences: retrieved versus generated. In addition, McNamara and Magliano (2009) proposed a similar distinction for inferences: bridging versus elaboration. We utilized these insights in order to develop a comprehensive but not overly specific classification of knowledge reasoning.\nThe second class defines the difficulty of reading contents, readability, in documents considering syntactic and lexical complexity. We leverage\na wide range of linguistic features proposed by Vajjala and Meurers (2012).\nIn the annotation, annotators selected sentences needed for answering and then annotated them with prerequisite skills under the same condition for RC datasets with different task formulations. Therefore, our annotation was equivalent in that the datasets were annotated from the point of view of whether a context entails a hypothesis that can be made from a question and its answer. This means our methodology could not evaluate the competence of looking for sentences that need to be read and answer candidates from the context. Therefore, our methodology was used to evaluate the understanding of contextual entailments in a broader sense for RC.\nThe contributions of this paper are as follows:\n1. We adopt two classes of evaluation metrics to show the qualitative features of RC datasets. Through analyses of RC datasets, we demonstrate that there is only a weak correlation between the difficulty of questions and the readability of context texts in RC datasets.\n2. We revise the previous classification of prerequisite skills for RC. Specifically, skills of knowledge reasoning are organized in terms of entailment phenomena and human text comprehension in psychology.\n3. We annotate six existing RC datasets with our organized metrics for the comparison and make the results publicly available.\nWe believe that our annotation results will help researchers to develop a method for the stepby-step construction of better RC datasets and a method to improve RC systems."

      "text" : "In this section, we present a short chronicle of RC datasets. To our knowledge, Hirschman et al. (1999) were the first to use NLP methods for RC. Their dataset consisted of reading materials for grades 3–6 with simple 5W (wh-) questions. Afterwards, investigations into natural language understanding questions mainly focused on other formulations, such as question answering (Yang et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2007; Voorhees et al., 1999) and textual entailment (Bentivogli et al., 2010; Sammons et al., 2010; Dagan et al., 2006).\n3\n201\n202\n203\n204\n205\n206\n207\n208\n209\n210\n211\n212\n213\n214\n215\n216\n217\n218\n219\n220\n221\n222\n223\n224\n225\n226\n227\n228\n229\n230\n231\n232\n233\n234\n235\n236\n237\n238\n239\n240\n241\n242\n243\n244\n245\n246\n247\n248\n249\n250\n251\n252\n253\n254\n255\n256\n257\n258\n259\n260\n261\n262\n263\n264\n265\n266\n267\n268\n269\n270\n271\n272\n273\n274\n275\n276\n277\n278\n279\n280\n281\n282\n283\n284\n285\n286\n287\n288\n289\n290\n291\n292\n293\n294\n295\n296\n297\n298\n299\nOne of the RC tasks following it was QA4MRE (Sutcliffe et al., 2013). The top accuracy of this task remained 59% at that time, and the size of the dataset was very limited: there were only 224 gold-standard questions, which is not enough for machine learning methods.\nThus, an important issue for designing RC datasets is their scalability. Richardson et al. (2013) presented MCTest, which is an opendomain narrative dataset for gauging comprehension at a childs level. This dataset was created by crowdsourcing and is based on scalable methodology. Since then, more large-scale datasets have been proposed with the development of machine learning. For example, the CNN/Daily Mail dataset (Hermann et al., 2015) and CBTest (Hill et al., 2016) have approximately 1.4M and 688K passages, respectively. These context texts and questions were automatically curated and generated from large corpora. However, Chen et al. (2016) indicated that approximately 25% of the questions in the CNN/Daily Mail dataset are unsolvable or nonsense. This has highlighted the demand for more stable and robust sourcing methods regarding dataset quality.\nIn addition to this, several RC datasets were presented in the last half of 2016 with large documents and sensible queries that were guaranteed by crowdsourcing or human testing. We explain those datasets in Section 4.2. They were aimed at achieving large and good-quality content for machine learning models. Nonetheless, as shown in the examples of Figure 1, there is room for improvement, and there is still no methodology available for evaluating the quality."

      "text" : "In psychology, there is a rich tradition of research on human text comprehension. The construction– integration (C–I) model (Kintsch, 1988) is one of the most basic and influential theories. This model assumes connectional and computational architecture for text comprehension. It assumes that comprehension is the processing of information based on the following steps:1\n1. Construction: Read sentences or clauses as inputs; form and elaborate concepts and propositions corresponding to the inputs.\n2. Integration: Associate the contents to consistently understand them (e.g., coreference,\n1Note that this is only a very simplified overview.\ndiscourse, and coherence).\nDuring these steps, three levels of representation are constructed (Van Dijk and Kintsch, 1983): the surface code (i.e., wording and syntax), the textbase (i.e., text propositions with cohesion), and the situation model (i.e., mental representation). Based on the above assumptions, McNamara and Magliano (2009) proposed two aspects of text comprehension: “strategic/skilled comprehension” and “text ease of processing.” We employed these assumptions as the basis of two classes of evaluation metrics (Section 3).\nOn the other hand, Kintsch (1993) proposed two dichotomies for the classification of human inferences, including the knowledge-based ones that are performed in the C–I model. The first is whether inferences are automatic or controlled. However, Graesser et al. (1994) indicated that this distinction is ambiguous because there is a continuum between the two states that depends on individuals. Therefore, this dichotomy is not suited for empirical evaluation, which we are working on attempting. The second is whether inferences are retrieved or generated. Retrieved means that the information used for inference is retrieved from context. In contrast, when inferences are generated, the reader uses external knowledge going beyond the context.\nA similar distinction was proposed by McNamara and Magliano (2009): bridging and elaboration. Bridging inference connects current information to other information that was previously encountered. Elaboration connects current information to external knowledge that is not in a context. We use these two types of inferences in the classification of knowledge reasoning."

Skills that have been modified/elaborated from the original definition are appended with an asterisk (∗), and new skills unique to this study are appended with a dagger (†).\n1. Object tracking∗: Jointly tracking or grasping of multiple objects, including set or membership (Clark, 1975). This skill is a renamed version of list/enumeration used in the original classification to emphasize its scope for multiple objects.\n2. Mathematical reasoning∗: We merged statistical and quantitative reasoning with mathematical reasoning. This skill is a renamed version of mathematical operations.\n3. Coreference resolution∗: This skill has a small modification: it includes one anaphora (Dagan et al., 2013). This skill is similar to direct reference (Clark, 1975).\n4. Logical reasoning∗: We reorganized this skill as understanding predicate logic, e.g., conditionals, quantifiers, negation, and transitivity. Note that mathematical reasoning and this skill are intended to align with offline skills mentioned by Graesser et al. (1994).\n5. Analogy∗: Understanding of metaphors including metonymy and synecdoche. See LoBue and Yates (2011) for examples of synecdoche.\n6. Causal relation: Understanding of causality that is represented by explicit expressions of why, because, the reason... (only if they exist).\n7. Spatiotemporal relation: Understanding of spatial and/or temporal relationships between multiple entities, events, and states.\nFor commonsense reasoning in the original classification, we defined the following four categories, which can be jointly required.\n8. Ellipsis†: Recognizing implicit/omitted information (argument, predicate, quantifier, time, place). This skill is inspired by Dagan et al. (2013)\nand the discussion of Sugawara et al. (2017). 9. Bridging†: Inferences between two facts supported by grammatical and lexical knowledge (e.g., synonymy, hypernymy, thematic role, part of events, idioms, and apposition). This skill is inspired by the concept of indirect reference in the literature (Clark, 1975). Note that we excluded direct reference because it is coreference resolution (pronominalization) or elaboration (epithets).\n10. Elaboration†: Inference using known facts, general knowledge (e.g., kinship, exchange, typical event sequence, and naming), and implicit relations (e.g., noun-compound and possessive) (see Dagan et al. (2013) for details). Bridging and elaboration are distinguished by whether knowledge used in inferences is grammatical/lexical versus general/commonsense.\n11. Meta-knowledge†: Using knowledge including a reader, writer, and text genre (e.g., narratives and expository documents) from metaviewpoints (e.g., Who are the principal characters of the story? and What is the main subject of this article?). Although this skill can be regarded as part of elaboration, we defined an independent skill because this knowledge is specific to RC.\nThe last two skills are intended to be performed on a single sentence.\n12. Schematic clause relation: Understanding of complex sentences that have coordination or subordination, including relative clauses.\n13. Punctuation∗: Understanding of punctuation marks (e.g., parenthesis, dash, quotation, colon, and semicolon). This skill is a renamed version of special sentence structure. Concerning the original definition, we regarded “scheme” in figures of speech as ambiguous and excluded it (ellipsis was defined as a skill, and apposition was merged into bridging). We did the same with understanding of constructions, which was merged into idioms in bridging.\nNote that we did not construct this classification to be dependent on RC models. This is because our methodology is intended to be general and applicable to many kinds of architectures."

This is because they presented a comparison of a wide range of linguistic features focusing on second language acquisition and their method can be applied to plain text.2\nWe list the readability metrics in Figure 2, which were reported by Vajjala and Meurers (2012) as the top ten features that affect human readability. To classify these metrics, we can place three classes: lexical features (NumChar, NumSyll, AWL, AdvVar, and ModVar), syntactic features (MLS, CoOrd, DC/C, and CN/C), and traditional features (Coleman). We applied these metrics only to sentences that needed to be read to answer questions. Nonetheless, because these metrics were proposed for human readability, they do not necessarily correlate with those for RC systems.

      "text" : "We present the results from evaluating the RC datasets according to the two classes of metrics. The inter-annotator agreement was 90.1% for 62 randomly sampled questions. The evaluation was performed according to the following four points of view (i)–(iv).\n(i) Frequencies of prerequisite skills (Table 2): QA4MRE had the highest scores for frequencies among the datasets. This seems to reflect the fact that QA4MRE has technical documents that contain a wide range of knowledge (bridging and elaboration), multiple clauses, and punctuation and that the questions are devised by experts.\nMCTest achieved high scores in several skills (first in causal relation and meta-knowledge and second in coreference resolution and spatiotemporal relation) and lower score in punctuation. These scores seem to be because the MCTest dataset consists of narratives.\nAnother dataset that achieved remarkable scores is Who-did-What. This dataset achieved the highest score for ellipsis. This is because the questions of Who-did-What are automatically generated from articles not used as context. This methodology can avoid textual overlap between a question and its context; therefore, the skills of ellipsis, bridging, and elaboration are frequently required.\nWith regard to nonsense, MS MARCO and Who-did-What received relatively high scores. This appears to have been caused by the automated curation, which may generate separation between the contents of the context and question (i.e., web segments and a search query in MS MARCO, and a context article and question article in Who-didWhat). In stark contrast, NewsQA had no nonsense questions. Although this result was affected by our filtering described in Appendix A, it is important to note that the NewsQA dataset includes annotations of meta information whether or not a question makes sense (is question bad).\n(ii) Number of required prerequisite skills (Table 3): QA4MRE had the highest score; on average, each question required 4.6 skills. There were few questions in QA4MRE that required zero or one skill, whereas the other datasets contained some questions that required zero or one skill. Table 3 also indicates that more than 90% of the MS MARCO questions required fewer than three skills, at least according to the annotation.\n(iii) Readability metrics for each dataset (Table 4): SQuAD and QA4MRE achieved the highest scores in most metrics; this reflects the fact that\n7\n601\n602\n603\n604\n605\n606\n607\n608\n609\n610\n611\n612\n613\n614\n615\n616\n617\n618\n619\n620\n621\n622\n623\n624\n625\n626\n627\n628\n629\n630\n631\n632\n633\n634\n635\n636\n637\n638\n639\n640\n641\n642\n643\n644\n645\n646\n647\n648\n649\n657\n658\n659\n660\n661\n662\n663\n664\n665\n666\n667\n668\n669\n670\n671\n672\n673\n674\n675\n676\n677\n678\n679\n680\n681\n682\n683\n684\n685\n686\n687\n688\n689\n690\n691\n692\n693\n694\n695\n696\n697\n698\n699\n1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 Average number of required skills 2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\nFK\ng ra\nde le\nve l QA4MRE\nMCTest\nSQuAD WDW\nMARCO NewsQA\nFigure 3: Flesch–Kincaid grade levels and average number of required prerequisite skills for the RC datasets.\n0 2 4 6 8 10 Number of required skills 10\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nFK\ng ra\nde le\nve l\nQA4MRE MCTest SQuAD\nFigure 4: Flesch–Kincaid grade levels and number of required prerequisite skills for all questions of the selected RC datasets.\nWikipedia articles and technical documents generally require a high grade level to understand. In contrast, MCTest had the lowest scores; its dataset consist of narratives for children.\n(iv) Correlation between numbers of required prerequisite skills and readability metrics (Figure 3, Figure 4, and Table 5): Our main interest was in the correlation between prerequisite skills and readability. To investigate this, we examined the relation between the number of required prerequisite skills and readability metrics (represented by the Flesch–Kincaid grade level), as shown in Figure 3 for each dataset and in Figure 4 for each question. The first figure shows the trends of the datasets. QA4MRE was relatively difficult both to read and to answer, and SQuAD was difficult to read but easy to answer. For further investigation, we selected three datasets (QA4MRE, MCTest, and SQuAD) and plotted all of their questions in the second figure. Three separate domains can be seen.\nTable 5 presents Pearson’s correlation coeffi-\ncients between the number of required prerequisite skills and each readability metric for all questions of the RC datasets. Although there are weak correlations from 0.025 to 0.416, the results highlight that there is not necessarily a strong correlation between the two values. This leads to the following two insights. First, the readability of RC datasets does not directly affect the difficulty of their questions. That is, RC datasets that are difficult to read are not necessary difficult to answer. Second, it is possible to create difficult questions from context that is easy to read. MCTest is a good example. The context texts of MCTest dataset are easy to read, but the difficulty of the questions is comparable to that of the other datasets.\nTo summarize our results in terms of each RC dataset, we present the following observations:\n- QA4MRE seemed to be the most difficult dataset among the RC datasets we analyzed, whereas MS MARCO seemed to be the easiest.\n- MCTest is a good example of an RC dataset that is easy to read but difficult to answer. The corpus’ genre (i.e., narrative) seems to reflect the trend of required skills for the questions.\n- SQuAD was difficult to read along with QA4MRE but relatively easy to answer compared to other datasets.\n- Who-did-What performed well in terms of its query sourcing method. Although its questions are automatically created, they are sophisticated in terms of knowledge reasoning. However, an issue with the automated sourcing method is excluding nonsense questions.\n- MS MARCO was a relatively easy dataset in terms of prerequisite skills. A problem is that the dataset contained nonsense questions.\n- NewsQA is advantageous in that it provides meta information on the reliability of the ques-\n8\n701\n702\n703\n704\n705\n706\n707\n708\n709\n710\n711\n712\n713\n714\n715\n716\n717\n718\n719\n720\n721\n722\n723\n724\n725\n726\n727\n728\n729\n730\n731\n732\n733\n734\n735\n736\n737\n738\n739\n740\n741\n742\n743\n744\n745\n746\n747\n748\n749\n750\n751\n752\n753\n754\n755\n756\n757\n758\n759\n760\n761\n762\n763\n764\n765\n766\n767\n768\n769\n770\n771\n772\n773\n774\n775\n776\n777\n778\n779\n780\n781\n782\n783\n784\n785\n786\n787\n788\n789\n790\n791\n792\n793\n794\n795\n796\n797\n798\n799\ntions.

      "heading" : "6 Discussion",
      "text" : "In this section, we discuss several matters regarding the construction of RC datasets and the development of RC systems using our methodology.\nHow to utilize the two classes of metrics for system development: One example for the development of an RC system is that it should be built to solve an easy-to-read and easy-to-answer dataset. The next step is to improve the system so that it can solve an easy-to-read and difficult-toanswer dataset. Finally, only after it can solve such dataset should the system be applied to a difficultto-read and difficult-to-answer dataset. Appropriate datasets can be prepared for every step by measuring their properties using the metrics of this study. Such datasets can be placed in a continuum based on the grades of the metrics and applied to each step of the development, like in curriculum learning (Bengio et al., 2009) and transfer learning (Pan and Yang, 2010).\nCorpus genre: Attention should be paid to the genre of corpus used to construct a dataset. Expository documents like news articles tend to require factorial understanding. Most existing RC datasets use such texts because of their availability. On the other hand, narrative texts have a close correspondence to our everyday experience, such as the emotion and intention of characters (Graesser et al., 1994). If we want to build agents that work in the real world, RC datasets may have to be constructed from narratives.\nQuestion type: In contrast to factorial understanding, comprehensive understanding of natural language texts needs a better grasp of the global coherence (e.g., the main point or moral of the text, goal of a story, and intention of characters) from the broad context (Graesser et al., 1994). Most questions that are prevalent now require only local coherence (e.g., referential relations and thematic roles) with a narrow context. Such questions based on global coherence may be generated by techniques of abstractive text summarization (Rush et al., 2015; Ganesan et al., 2010).\nAnnotation issues: There were questions for which there were disagreements regarding the decision of nonsense. For example, some questions can be solved by external knowledge without seeing their context. Thus, we should clarify what a\nSentence QA4MRE MCTest SQuAD WDW MARCO NewsQA\nNumber 1.120 1.180 1.040 1.110 1.080 1.170 Distance 1.880 0.930 0.090 0.730 0.280 0.540\nTable 6: Average number and distance of sentences that need to be read to answer a question in the RC datasets.\n“solvable” or “reasonable” question is in RC. In addition, annotators reported that the prerequisite skills did not easily treat questions whose answer was “none of the above” in QA4MRE. We considered those “no answer” questions difficult in another sense, so our methodology failed to specify them.\nCompetence of selecting necessary sentences: As mentioned in Section 1, our methodology cannot evaluate the competence of selecting sentences that need to be read to answer questions. As a brief analysis, we further investigated sentences in the context of the datasets that were highlighted in the annotation. Analyses were performed in two ways: for each question, we counted the number of required sentences and their distance (see Appendix B for the calculation method). The values of the first row in Table 6 show the average number of required sentences per question for each RC dataset. Although the scores seemed to be approximately level, MCTest required multiple sentences the most frequently. The second row presents the average distance of required sentences. QA4MRE demonstrated the longest distance because readers had to look for clues in long context texts of the dataset. In contrast, SQuAD and MS MARCO showed lower scores: most of their questions seem only to require reading a single sentence to answer. Of course, the scores of distances should depend on the length of the context texts."
